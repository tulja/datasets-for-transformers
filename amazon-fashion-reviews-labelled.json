First, in moderately cold skiing weather 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, my face was a little cold through this mask.  While skiing downhill, the wind shred through this mask.  Second, after only 1 weekend of moderate use, the front of the mask was worn away.  I would not be surprised if it tore during the 2nd weekend of use.  Third, I have a medium sized head and this thing was wayyyy too big for me.  Finally, the mask traps the moisture of my breath and freezes it, making the mask uncomfortable around the mouth area.\n\nThe only pros are that it is lightweight and breathable.", "summary": "Not Durable or Made for Cold Weather", "unixReviewTime": 1201651200,"label":"negative"}
