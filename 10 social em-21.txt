In this chapter, we shall study about the relief features, by relief features we
mean physical features like mountains, plains, plateaus of India. In the subsequent
chapters such as Climate of India; Indian rivers and water resources; The population
etc, we would examine the linkages with relief featureER

In our country the young population is often not able to access higher education due to lack of
funds. To alleviate this bottleneck the Educational Loan Scheme has been designed. The main
objective of the scheme is to provide financial support from the banking system to students for
pursuing higher education in India and abroad. The maximum loan limit for studies in India is 10
lakh while for overseas studies the limit is Rs. 20 lakh.
A student to be eligible for this loan, should be an Indian national and should have secured
admission to a higher education course in recognized institutions in India or abroad through
entrance test / merit based selection process after completion of HSC (10+2 or equivalent). In
other cases, appropriate criteria will be adopted by the banks based on reputation of the
concerned institution and employment opportunity that the intended course offers.
The eligible loan amount is arrived at by including all education related expenses such as
Tuition fee, cost of books, boarding and lodging charges. The parents of the student should be
joint borrowers along with assessment of future income of the student.

AL

The student or his parents are not required to service the loan during the duration of the
course and the repayment of loan commences either six months after the student is employed or
one year after the completion of the course which ever is earlier.
There are no processing charges and to avail this scheme eligible students can approach any
commercial bank.

Letter to students
“Dear Young Friends,

AN

A

Most of you are growing up in the 21st Century and soon will be old enough to take up a
profession and participate fully in public matters like voting in the elections. It is time you tried to
understand the ideas, processes and systems which determine life in our times. These were
shaped by people through very hard struggles, sacrifices and great acts of cooperative action. As
the next century unfolds it will be your turn to shape our future in similar manner. We hope this
book will help you to a small extent by going over with you how the people of the last century
shaped their ideas, processes and systems.

G

Your parents and teachers were witnesses and participants in this. As such they will surely
have strong and differing views on many of these matters. While you try to understand the last
century you also therefore need to understand why people hold such divergent views on it and
come to your own conclusions.

AN

This book is in two parts. The first part deals with Resources Development and Equity and the
second part with Contemporary World and India. Under the theme “Resources Development and
Equity” we will explore how we have used the land in which we live and how we engage in
productive activities. Did we properly use the land and its resources? The way we engaged in
productive work and distributed its fruits among different people, was it just and sustainable?

TE

AL

Under the theme “Contemporary World and India” we will explore the impact of major events
of the last century. We will not only be studying what happened over the entire world, but also
what happened in our own country including the recent past. People act not only because they are
moved by different interests but also because they are inspired by different ideas. In the last
century ideas like socialism, fascism, nationalism, liberalism greatly influenced the thinking and
collective actions of people. We will be studying about some of these too.

SC
ER
T,

Textbooks at school level tend not to discuss contemporary events, policies and politics. This is
not because it is too difficult to understand but because opinion about it is sharply divided and it is
feared that this will generate conflicts. However, to live in a democratic world, we also need to
learn to handle our differences and conflicts rather than avoid talking about them. This book is a
bold attempt at initiating our young adults to the world of political debates and differences. It will
be successful only if the teachers, students and the political community take it in the right spirit,
practice restraint and listen carefully to differing points of view with tolerance and understanding.
It may turn out that this book seems to give a particular view point and not represent some other
point of view in proper light. This is very difficult to avoid as textbook writers are human and have
their own understanding. When such issues come to light it is important for the teachers to present
the other view points too before the students and not treat the book as the only or correct source
of information. The students too should be encouraged to read current newspapers, magazines
etc; attend public meetings to get more perspectives on these matters.
This book then should be seen as a starting point of enquiry rather than as the end of it.
Books can only tell you what others thought and did. At the end of it you need to decide for
yourself your understanding and what you want to do about the social problems you will be
studying. You have the responsibility of both understanding the society and acting to make it
better. We only hope that this book will help you in this.

ABOUT THIS BOOK

SC
ER
T,

TE

AL

AN

G

AN

A

This book is a part of your Social Science Curriculum and a part of various things you would be
doing to study the society around you. However, remember that it is only one small part of that
curriculum. The Social Science Curriculum requires you to analyse and share in the classroom what
you know. It requires you above all to ask questions – think why things are the way they are. It also
requires you and your friends to go out of the class room to the market, to the village fields, to
temples and mosques and museums and find out various things. You will have to meet and discuss
with a number of people, farmers, shopkeepers, officials, priests and so on.
This book will introduce you to a range of problems and enable you to study them and arrive
at your own understanding of them. So, the most important thing about this book is that it does not
have answers. In fact this book is not really complete. It can only be completed when you and your
friends and teachers bring their own questions and experiences and discuss everything threadbare in
the class. You may disagree with many things in this book - do not be afraid to say so - only give
your reasons. Your friends may disagree with you, but try to understand why they have a different
view. Finally arrive at your own answers. You may not even be sure of your answer - you may want
to find out more before you make up your mind. In that case list your questions carefully and request
your friends, teachers or elders to help you to find out.
In this class we will be mainly studying India in the context of the contemporary world. The
last hundred years have been years of momentous change in the world as two major World Wars
were fought, scores of countries emerged as independent nations, and great experiments were done
in order to build just, equitable and democratic world.
India, after its independence pursued policies to harness the natural resources of the country
for economic development to eradicate poverty, reduce dependence on other countries for food
grains and industrial goods, and generate gainful employment within the country. Equally important,
it embarked upon an ambitious project of developing India as the largest democracy in the world
with guarantee of personal liberty and freedom. We will be studying both aspects of India’s
development its economy, election process and its polity in this book. Since these issues affect us in
our own lives and affect different sections of the society differently, there are bound to be different
view points about them. We need to learn in our class rooms how to engage with these different
perspectives and understand them with sensitivity. This is necessary to strengthen our democratic
fabric.
As you study this book in the classroom, you will come across many questions - do stop and
try to answer those questions or do the activity suggested before you proceed ahead. It is not so
important to finish the lesson fast as it is to discuss the questions and do the activities.
Many lessons will suggest projects which may take a few days to do. These projects will
enable you to develop skills of social science enquiry and analysis and presentation - these are more
important than remembering what is written in the lessons.
Please remember that you don't have to memorise what is given in the lesson, but think about
them and form your own opinion about them.

USING THIS BOOK: NOTE TO THE TEACHER AND STUDENTS

SC
ER
T,

TE

AN

AN

This textbook is not to be seen as the final authority, but has to be discussed, debated and
questioned. In fact each chapter in this book provides opportunity for a systematic discussion on
some of the main issues relating to a topic. It would be good if the teachers could ensure that the
chapters are read out in the class and discussions conducted along the lines suggested.
The language of the text: Efforts have been taken to write the text of this book in child friendly
manner. However there are certain terms and jargons that will need explanation and clarification.
Text is often trying to give examples that may be suitable to the concept that is discussed. Each
chapter has central ideas, these are often provided as subheadings. In a classroom, you may be
able to cover 2 or 3 subheadings in a period roughly.
This textbook uses different style of writing, sometimes they are narratives like Narasimha and
Rajeshwari in chapter 3, to make the students understand the difference between both of them
with regard to their livelihood and working conditions. These narratives reflect the facts existing in
the society. In chapter 8, the students understand the economy of a village by reading the case
study of Rampur Village and compare the activities discussed here with their own village economy.
There are also some tables, graphs like pie charts, bar graphs in chapters 6, 8, 11 and 12. These
are for analysis and discussion so as to come to a conclusion on different issues.
In earlier classes, you have come across natural disasters and a few Acts on Women Protection,
a little bit about RTI and RTE. This year you could try to know about the agitations held for the
formation of Telangana as a separate state in chapter 21.
Use of in between questions and end text questions: You will note that there are questions in
between the text. Do not leave out these questions. These are integral to the teaching learning
process. These questions are of different types – some of them help you to recap, summarise,
evaluating important ideas from the passages that you may have read out. Or they are for collecting
more information that is around the concepts discussed in the previous topic or sub-topic. Do not
try to dictate the answers to these questions, allow the students to find the answers on their own.
Allow them to have discussions amongst each other in trying to figure out the meaning of these
questions and talk about possible answers.
There are different types of questions used in the book:
They (i) ask students to write their experiences; (ii) compare their experiences with that of the
examples given in the text; (iii) compare two or three different situations given in the textbooks; (iv)
are questions that ask students to give their opinion about the situation or case study (when these
opinions are asked it need not be the same for all children, allow them to express their opinion)
and (v) evaluate a particular situation given in the chapter.
Teacher may adopt different strategies in using these questions in the classroom. Some questions
may be written down in the notebook; others may be discussed in small groups; a few may be
written as individual tasks. In all situations it is important to encourage the student to write in
her or his own words. Avoid instructing all children to write the answers in same style and structure.

There are certain boxes in the chapters. These are often additional information on the concepts
discussed in the chapter. It is important to discuss them in the classroom, and conduct the
activities around.
Images used in the textbooks: We have also tried to use different styles of images like
photographs, line drawings, cartoons and posters etc. These are taken from different historical
points of time and from different sources. Hence just as different styles used in textbooks there
is diversity in the images too. Many of the pictures have questions along with the captions – these
may be discussed in the class as they will help you to draw the attention of students on the
significance of images.
Maps, tables and graphs: Maps in these books tell us about geographic, economic, political
and historical aspects. They are used to present the information in an interesting manner. You will
also find the use of tables and graphs. Reading tables and graphs are essential in Social Studies.
These often provide much more clarity in explaining the concepts.
Projects: There are different projects suggested in the book. It may not be possible for all
projects to be undertaken. It is important to remember that we cannot teach all aspects of
concepts merely by reading textbook. Projects thus enable students to interact with members of
the society, collect new information, arrange and present them in their own manner. Making
questions for an interview, planning for a visit to the bank, or creating a presentation that could
include images, tabulated data or graphs based on the information they collected are also important
in acquiring Social Studies skills. These encourage children to work together in groups and
conduct exchange and share ideas.
We can use content related maps, tables & graphs other than text book for practice and evaluation.
Discussions, conducting interviews, debates and projects are given in the middle of the running
lesson and after the improve your learning. To develop social consiousness, sensitivity and positive
attitude among the children is the purpose. Hence these must be taken up.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS

A

Time should be spent in making sure that children comprehend the passages given in
text. In between questions are useful in this context. These questions are of different types
that would include the aspects reasoning, cause and effect, justification, mind mapping /
concept mapping, observation, analysis, thinking and imagination, reflection, interpreting
etc. The key concepts have been discussed sub-conceptwise in every chapter with examples
and also given in the form of keywords.
Conceptual understanding (AS1) : Promoting learning of basic concepts through inquiry,
discussion, reflection giving examples through case studies interpreting, observation etc.

2)

Reading the text (given), understanding and interpretation (AS2) : Occasionally there are
case studies about farmers, labourers in factory, or images that are used in text which do not
directly convey the concept. Time should be given for children to grasp the main ideas,
interpret images etc.

3)

Information skills (AS3) : Textbooks alone cannot cover all different aspects of social studies
methodology. For example children living in an urban area can collect information regarding
their elected representatives or children living in the rural area can collect information
about the way irrigation / tank facilities are made available in their area. These information
may not exactly match with that of the textbooks and will have to be clarified. Representing
the information that they have collected through projects are also an important ability. For
example if they collect information about a tank – they may decide to draw an illustration or
map etc along with written material. Or represent the information collected through images
or posters. Information skill includes, collection of informatic tabulation / records and
analysis.

4)

Reflection on contemporary issues and questioning (AS4) : Students need to be encouraged
to compare their living conditions along with that of different regions or people from
different times. There may not be a single answer to these situations of comparison. Giving
reasons for certain happening process and justification of informatic and interpretative.

5)

Mapping skills (AS5) : There are different types of maps and pictures used in the textbook.
Developing ability related to maps as abstract representation of places are important. There
are different stages of developing this ability, from creating a map of their classroom to
understanding height, distance as represented in a map. There are illustrations, posters and
photographs used in the textbook, these images often relate to the text and are not merely
for visual effect. Sometimes there are activities like write a caption or read the images that
are about architecture etc.

6)

Appreciation and Sensitivity (AS6) : Our country has vast diversity in terms of language,
culture, caste, religion, gender etc. Social studies does take into consideration these different
aspects and encourages students to be sensitive to these differences.

Mention any two places you would like to see in our country. Write the reasons

Re-read, about the movement of the Earth’s crust from the class IX book.
Indian landmass, as part of Gondwana land, originated due to geological formations
and several other processes like weathering, erosion and deposition. These
processes, over millions of years, have created and modified the physical features
as they appear to us today.
World landforms originated from two giant lands namely Angara land
(Laurasia) and Gondwana land. The Indian peninsula was part of Gondwana land.
Over 200 million years ago Gondwana land split into pieces and the peninsular
Indian plate moved towards North-East and collided into the much larger Eurasian
Plate (Angara land). Owing to the collision and immense compression force,
mountains evolved through a folding process over millions of years. The present
form of the Himalayas is a result of this process.
The breaking off from the northern corners of the peninsular plateau led
to the formation of a large Basin. In due course of time, this basin slowly got filled
with sediments deposited by the Himalayan rivers from north and peninsular rivers
from south. This created the

There are also altitudinal variations across the regions. The Himalayas comprise
three parallel ranges. These ranges are separated with deep valleys and extensive
plateaus.

the Mussoorie Range, the Nag Tiba and Mahabharata Lekh are some of the important
ranges of the Middle Himalaya.
The Pir Panjal, southern most range of the Middle Himalaya, in the Kashmir is
the longest and the most important range. Between the Pir Panjal and the Zaskar
range of the Main Himalayas, lies the famous valley of Kashmir running over a
distance of about 135 km in south-east to north-west direction. This valley is about
40 km broad and extend in the area of 4921 sq km with the average elevation of
1,585 mt. above mean sea level.
Further east, the Middle Himalayas are marked by the Mussoorie and the Nag
Tiba Ranges. The Mussoorie Range has an average elevation of 2,000-2,600 m and
runs over a distance of 120 km from Mussoorie to Lansdowne. Mussorie, Nainital,
Chakrata and Ranikhet are some of the important hill station situated between 1,500

The Shiwalik Range

The Shiwalik Himalaya formed in the last stage of formation of Himalaya. It
comprises the outermost range of the Himalayas and is also known as outer
Himalayas. It has a hogback like appearance due to its steep northern slope. This
range runs parallel to the lesser Himalayas for a distance of about 2,400 km from
the Potwar Plateau to the Brahmaputra valley. The width of the Shiwaliks varies
from 50 km in Himachal Pradesh to less than 15 km in Arunachal Pradesh. It is
almost an unbroken succession of low hills accept a gap of 80-90 km which is
occupied by the valley of Tista river. The altitude of Shiwaliks varies from 600 to
1500 meters.
As the Shiwaliks are last in formation of Himalayas, they obstructed the flow
of river from the upper reaches of the Himalayas and formed big lakes in the valleys.
The silt and sediments brought by the rivers got deposited in these lakes. After the
rivers had cut their course through the Shiwalik Ranges, the lakes are drained away
leaving behind plains called Duns in the west and Duars in the east. Dehradun in
Uttaranchal is the best example of such plain which is 75 km long and 15-20 km
wide.
The eastern most boundary of the Himalayas is the Brahmaputra valley. In
Arunachal Pradesh beyond the Dihang valley, the Himalayas take hair pin bend to
the south and act as the eastern boundary of India and run through the north eastern
states. These divisions are known as ‘Purvanchal’ and mostly composed of
sedimentary sand stones. Regionally, the Purvanchal are known as Patkai hills, the
Naga hills, Manipuri hills, Khasi and Mizo hills.

The formation of the Himalayas influences India’s climate in various ways.
These act as barriers protecting the great plains of India from the cold winds of
central Asia during severe winter. The Himalayas are the reason for summer rains
and monsoon type of climate in regions that are beyond the Western Ghats of
India. In its absence, this region would have remained drier. The Himalayan Rivers
have a perennial flow since these are fed by the glaciers and bring a lot of silt,
making these plains very fertile.

The Indo-Gangetic Plain

The interaction of the three Himalayan rivers, Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra
and their tributaries resulted in the formation of great northern plains. In the
beginning (about 20 million years ago), it was a shallow basin that was gradually
filled with varied alluvial soil that these rivers brought from the Himalayas.
The Indo-Gangetic Plains broadly consist of three divisions :
1. The Western Part 2. The Central Part 3. The Eastern Part
1) The western part was formed by the Indus and its tributaries, the Jhelum, the
Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Sutlej flowing from the Himalayas. Most of the
Indus river basin is located in Pakistan leaving minor portion of Punjab and Haryana
plains in India. In this region, the ‘Doab’ features dominate the fertile land between
the two rivers.

The Himalayan rivers, while flowing down, deposit gravel and pebble sediments
in a narrow belt of 8 to 16 kms width found parallel to foot hills of Shivaliks. This
feature is known as ‘Bhabar’. Bhabar is porous in nature. Small rivers and streams
flow underground through Bhabar and reappear in lower areas and form a swampy
and marshy region called Terai. The region had thick forests and rich variety of
wild life. However, owing to migration at the time of India’s partition, most of the
Terai zone has now been cleared and used for agricultural operations. Fine alluvial
plain regions are found towards the South of the Terai region.

The Peninsular Plateau

The Indian plateau is also known as the peninsular plateau as it is surrounded
by the sea on three sides. It is mainly composed of the old crystalline, hard igneous
and metamorphic rock. Large amounts of metallic and non metallic mineral
resources are found in the Indian plateau. It has broad and shallow valleys with
rounded hills. The topography of the plateau is slightly tilted towards east and the
Western and Eastern Ghats form the western and eastern edges respectively. The
southernmost tip of the plateau is Kanyakumari.

We all have many aspirations about
what we would like to do and how we

ideas about what a country should be

we require? Can life be better for all?
Can there be more equality?

If, even the idea of what
constitutes development can be

certainly there can be many
differences about ways in which
developoment happens. The
ongoing protest over the
Kudankulam Nuclear Power
Project in the Tirunelveli district
Fig 2.3 : Protest at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project of Tamil Nadu is one such
conflict. The government of
India set up the nuclear power plant in this quiet coastal town of fisher folks. The aim
is to generate nuclear power to meet the growing energy needs of the country. The
people in the region have protested on the grounds of safety, security and livelihood.
A long struggle has ensued. Scientists, environmentalists, social activists who have
been critical of the project, have stood by the people and supported their protest.

TE

Letters of protests to the government state “You are unable or unwilling to
appreciate that in nuclear energy, we are confronted not only with an immense power,
but also an incredible potential for destruction.

SC
ER
T,

We want our coast and country protected from the radioactive peril. Stop the
project. Look to renewable energy as an alternative.” The government has responded
that the plant has followed all the safety measures and, despite protests, is going
ahead with the project. Nuclear energy is considered as a clean source of energy and
alternative energy sources may not be sufficient to meet the demands.
So, two things are quite clear from the above discussion:

1. Different persons can have different developmental goals and
2. What may be development for one may not be development for the other. It
may even be destructive for the other.

What can be some of the developmental goals for your village or town or locality?
What are the issues of conflict between government and the people living in

Besides seeking more income – one-way or the other, people also seek things

more important than more income or more consumption because material goods
are not all that you need to live. Money or material things that one can buy with it
is just one factor on which our life depends. But the quality of our life also depends

job security and also leave no time for your family. This will reduce your sense of
security and freedom.

Similarly, for development, people look at a mix of goals. It is true that if
women are engaged in paid work, the family income increases and their dignity in
the household and society increases. However, at the same time if there is respect
for women, there would be more sharing of housework and a greater acceptance of
women working outside. A safe and secure environment may allow more women to
take up a variety of jobs or run a business.

Hence, the developmental goals that people have are not only about better
income but also about other important things in life.

Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.

How to Compare Different Countries or States
When we compare different things, there could be similarities as well as
differences. Which aspects do we use to compare them? Let us look at the students
in a class itself. How do we compare different students? They differ in their
height, health, talents and interests. The healthiest student may not be the most
studious one. The most intelligent student may not be the friendliest one. So, how
do we compare students? The criterion we may use depends on the purpose of
comparison. We use different criteria to choose a sports team, a debate team, a
music team or a team to organise a picnic. Still, if for some purpose, we have to
choose the criteria for the all-round progress of children in the class, how do we
do it?
Usually, we take one or more important characteristics of persons and compare
them based on these characteristics. For comparing countries, their income is
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22

19

considered to be one of the most important attributes. Countries with higher income
are more developed than countries with lower income. This is done based on the
understanding that more income means more access to things that human beings
need to fulfill their basic requirements. Whatever people like and should have,
they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered
to be one important goal.

AN

A

Now, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is
total of the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income
of the country.

AN

G

However, for comparison between countries, total income is not such a useful
measure. Since countries have different populations, comparing total income will
not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country
better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income
which is total income of the country divided by total population. The average income
is also called per capita income.

SC
ER
T,

TE

AL

This criterion is used in the World Development Report brought out by the
World Bank to classify countries. Countries with per capita income of US $12,055
and above per annum in 2017 are called high income countries or rich countries.
Those with per capita income of US $995 or less per annum in 2017 are called
low-income countries. Until less than a decade ago, India came in the category of
low income countries. Now it falls under the category of middle income countries.
As the per capita income in India rose faster than that of many countries, its position
has improved. We will read more about growth of incomes of people in India in
the next chapter.
The rich countries, excluding countries of West Asia and certain other small
countries are generally called developed countries.
While ‘averages’ are useful for comparison, they also hide many disparities.

For example, let us consider two countries, A and B. For the sake of simplicity,
we have assumed that they have only five citizens each. Based on data given in
Table 2, calculate the average income for both the countries.

Will you be equally happy to live in either of these countries? Are both equally
developed? Perhaps some of us may like to live in country B if we are assured of
being its fifth citizen but if it is a lottery that decides our citizenship number then
perhaps most of us will prefer to live in country A. Though both the countries have
identical average income, country A is preferred because it has more equitable
distribution. In this country, people are neither very rich nor extremely poor,
while most citizens in country B are poor and one person is extremely rich. Hence,
while average income is useful for comparison, it does not tell us how this income
is distributed among people.

but also have goals such as security,
respect of others, equal treatment,
freedom etc. Similarly, when we think
of a nation or a region, we may think of
other equally important attributes
besides average income.

Table 4 : Some Comparative data of Selected States

A

What could these attributes be? Let us examine this through an example. Table 3
gives the per capita income of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar. We find that
out of the three, Haryana has the highest per capita income and Bihar is at the
bottom. This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs.2.15 lakhs in
one year whereas, on an average, a person in Bihar would earn only around
Rs. 0.66 lakhs. So, if the per capita income were to be used as the measure of
development, Haryana would be considered the most developed and Bihar the least
developed state of the three. Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to
these states given in Table 4.

First column of the table shows that in Himachal Pradesh, out of 1000 children
born alive, 25 died before completing one year of age. In Haryana, the number of
children dying within one year of birth is 33. In Bihar, the number is 38.

Public Facilities

How is it that the average person in Haryana has more income than the average
person in Himachal Pradesh but lags behind in these crucial areas? The reason is
money in your pocket cannot buy all the goods and services that you may need to
live well. So, income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material
goods and services that citizens are able to use. For example, normally your money
cannot buy you a pollution free environment or ensure that you get unadulterated
medicines, unless you can afford to shift to a community that already has all these
things. Money may also not be able to protect you from infectious diseases, unless
the whole of your community takes preventive steps.
Actually, for many of the important things in life the best way, also the cheapest
way, is to provide these goods and services collectively. Just think: will it be cheaper

to have collective security for the whole locality or for each house to have its own
security guard? What if no one other than you in your village or locality is interested
in studying? Would you be able to study? Not unless your parents could afford to
send you to some private school elsewhere. So, you are actually able to study
because many other children also want to study and because many people believe
that the government should open schools and provide other facilities so that all
children have a chance to study. Even now, in many areas, children, particularly
girls, are not able to achieve secondary level schooling because government/ society
has not provided the required facilities.
Some states have lower Infant Mortality Rate because they have adequate
provision of basic health care and educational facilities. Similarly, in some states,
the Public Distribution System (PDS) functions well. If a PDS shop, i.e. ration
shop, does not function properly in such places, the people there are able to get it
rectified. Health and nutritional status of people of such states is certainly likely
to be better.

AL

Look at the data in Tables 3 and 4. Is Haryana as ahead of Bihar in literacy rate etc.
as it is in terms of per capita income?

SC
ER
T,

TE

Think of other examples where collective provision of goods and services is
cheaper than individual provision.
Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend only on the
amount of money spent by the government on these facilities? What other factors
could be relevant?
For a family in rural areas in Tamil Nadu and combined Andhra Pradesh in 20092010, rice purchased from ration shops account for 53 and 33 per cent respectively.
The rest they buy from markets. In West Bengal and Assom, only 11 and 6 per
cent of rice was purchased from ration shops. Where would people be better off
and why?

Human Development Report

When we realise that even though the level of income is important, it is an inadequate
measure of the level of development, we begin to think of other criterion. There could
be a long list of such criteria but then it would not be so useful. What we need is a
small number of the most important things. Health and education indicators, such as
the ones we used in comparison of Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, are among them.
Over the past decade or so, health and education indicators have come to be widely
used along with income as a measure of development. For instance, Human
Development Report published by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
compares countries based on the educational attainment of the people, their health
status and per capita income.

Isn’t it surprising that a small country in our neighbourhood, Sri Lanka, is
much ahead of India in every respect and a big country like ours has such a low
rank in the world? Table 5 also shows that though Nepal has less than half the per
capita income of India, it is not far behind India in educational level. In terms of
life expectancy at birth, it is in fact ahead of India.

AN

A

Many improvements have been suggested in calculating HDI and many new
components have been added to the Human Development Report. But, by prefixing “Human” to “Development”, HDR has made it very clear that what is
happening to citizens of a country is very important in development. People, their
health and their well-being are most important for the development of a country.

Development as progress over time

AL

AN

G

Some countries are ahead of others in terms of human development indicators.
Similarly, some states have better indicators of human development, though within
a state, there may be variations. Some districts may be more advanced than others.
Remember that comparison and ranks have little use by them. They are only useful
if these indicators can make us think in meaningful ways as to why are some behind
the others. Low performance on any of the human development indicators is a
sign that certain aspects of people’s lives needs more attention than the others.
Alternately, we could ask why are some ahead of others. Say, why are many more
children in Himachal Pradesh going to school on an average than in other states
(refer to Table 4)?

SC
ER

TE

To answer this, let us look closely at what has come to be called ‘the schooling
revolution in Himachal Pradesh’. It has some interesting insights to offer,
particularly, how so many factors need to come together to make change possible.
Development is indeed a complex phenomenon.
At the time of Indian independence, like most other states in India, Himachal
Pradesh had very low levels of education. Being a hilly region, with low density of
population in many villages, spread of schools, particularly to the rural areas,
appeared to be big challenge. However,

25

went by, these facilities were improved and expanded. More schools were opened
and teachers were appointed so that many more children could study easily. Of
course, to open schools and run them well, the government had to spend money.
Among the Indian states, Himachal Pradesh has the distinction of one of the highest
spending from the government budget on education of each child. In the year 2005,
the average spending on education by the government in Indian states was Rs 1,049
per child on the other hand, Himachal Pradesh was spending Rs. 2,005 per child!

A

The high priority on education paid off. In an intensive survey on schooling
done in 1996 and repeated in 2006, the surveyors noted:

AN

G

AN

Students in Himachal Pradesh come to school enthusiastically. An overwhelming
proportion of students enjoyed their schooling experience: “The teacher loves
us and teaches us well”, said Neha, enrolled in Class 4 in a village in Chamba.
Children had dreams of studying till higher classes and aspirations to be
policemen, scientists and teachers. The attendance rate was very high in primary
classes, but also among older children.

The norm in Himachal Pradesh has come to at least 10 years of schooling for
children.

SC
ER
T,

TE

AL

In many parts of the country, girls’ education is still given less priority by the
parents as compared to boys’ education. While girls may study for a few years,
they may not complete their schooling. A welcome trend in Himachal Pradesh is
the lower gender bias. Himachali parents have ambitious educational goals for
their girls, just as for their boys. Thus, in the 13-18 age group, a very high
percentage of girls are completing class VIII and moving to secondary classes.
This doesn’t mean there are no differences in the status of men and women, but the
differences are less as compared to many other regions, particularly north Indian
states.
One may wonder why the gender bias is less in Himachal Pradesh as compared
to other states. Besides education, this can be seen in other areas as well. Child
mortality (children dying within a few years of birth) in Himachal Pradesh is lower
for girls than for boys, in contrast to most other states. One major consideration is
that many Himachali women are themselves employed outside the home. Women
who work outside the homes are economically independent and self-confident.
They have greater say in household decisions, including children’s education, health,
birth, upkeep etc. Also, being employed themselves, Himachali mothers expect
their daughters to work outside home after marriage. Schooling, therefore, comes
naturally and has become a social norm.

It has been seen that Himachali women have a comparatively high involvement
in social life and village politics. Active mahila mandals can be found in many
villages.

The comparison across two different years is indicative of development that has
happened. Clearly, there has been greater development in schooling and spread of
education in Himachal Pradesh than India as a whole. Though there is still difference
in the average levels of education among boys and girls, i.e. across genders, there has
been some progress towards greater equality in the recent years.

process; b) manufacturing processes & other industries, where goods are produced
by people using tools or machines; and c) those activities that do not result in a
good but provide services that are required in production and other services for
people.

Gross Domestic Product

Suppose there are two families – a rich family and a poor family. We can make
such judgements as “rich” or “poor” based on: the dress people in the family wear,
the vehicles they use to travel, the food they eat, the house they live in, furniture
and other equipment they have, hospitals they go to for treatment etc. Alternately,
income that these families earn is an important overall indicator. For the country
as a whole, we use the total value of final goods and services produced in the
country during the year as the indicator of income for the country. The technical
term to denote this value is Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The following Graph 1 shows the value of GDP for India for two different
years: 1973-74 and 2013-2014. One can compare the kind of increase that has

How do we estimate GDP?

People engaged in various economic activities in the above sectors produce a
large number of goods and services. What we desire to find out is: how many final
goods and services are produced during a year.

SC
ER
T,

With as many as thousands of goods and services being produced, you might
think this is an impossible task. Not only would the task be enormous, you might
also wonder how we can add up the total numbers of cars, computers, mobile phone
service, baskets and pots. It won’t make sense!
To get around this problem, economists suggest that the value of final goods
and services should be used rather than adding up the actual numbers. For example,
if 10,000 kilograms of paddy are sold at Rs. 25 per kg, the total value of paddy will
be Rs. 2,50,000. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs. 10 per coconut will be Rs.
50,000. Is it necessary to count every good (or service) that is produced and sold?
How do we estimate the total value of goods and services?
Take, for instance, a farmer who sells paddy to a rice mill for Rs. 25 per kg.
She sells 100 kilograms of paddy. Let us assume that she did not have to buy any
seeds. The total value of paddy produced by her is Rs. 2500. The rice mill takes out
rice and sells (i) 80 kilograms of rice to the hotelier for Rs. 40 per kg and (ii) 20
kilograms of husk at Rs. 20 per kg. The total value of goods produced by the rice
miller is: (80 x 40) + (20 x 20) = Rs. 3600. This is what the hotelier pays the rice

miller. The hotelier makes idli, dosa and husk is used as a fuel by him. The hotel
owner, by using rice and husk, makes out Rs. 5000 from the sale of idli, dosa.
Total value of goods sold at each stage:
Stage 1 (sale of paddy by farmer to rice mill owner)

Goods such as paddy, rice and husk in this example are at the intermediary
stages. They are not being used by the final consumer. They are used as inputs to
make the final good, which in this example is idli and dosa. If one were to add the
value of all the physical inputs in between plus the value of the final goods, we
would be double counting. The value of final goods already includes the value of
all the in between or intermediate goods that are used in making the final good. At
each stage, the producer paid for these inputs produced by someone before. Hence,
the value of Rs. 5000 worth of hotel items sold by hotelier (final good) already
includes Rs. 3600, the value of rice and husk used as physical inputs. This was not
made by the hotelier but he only purchased them from the rice miller. Similarly,
the rice and husk produced by the miller at Rs. 3600 already includes the value of
physical input paddy (Rs. 2500) purchased by him. He did not produce paddy. The
farmer produced this in stage 1. To count the value of the rice and paddy separately
means counting the value of the same things a number of times - first as paddy,
then as rice and husk and finally as idli and dosa.
The good becomes final if it is not used further in producing goods to be sold.
In the above example, if the rice had been bought by a family for their consumption,
this would be the final point. Idli and dosa would be made by the family for
themselves and not as goods to be sold.

Another way of looking at these stages is to focus only on the value added at
every step by the producer of the good. To find out the value added by the producer
to the physical inputs purchased by him, we will relook at the above example:
Stage 1 (sale of paddy by farmer to rice miller) = Value Added Rs. 2500 (obtained by
deducting input value zero from product value Rs. 2500)
Stage 2 (sale of rice and husk by rice miller to hotelier) = Value Added Rs.3600
(obtained by deducting input value of Rs.2500 from product value Rs.3600)
Stage 3 (sale of idlis, dosas) = Value Added Rs. 1400 (Obtained by deducting input
value of Rs.3600 from product value Rs.5000)
Total Value Added (stage wise) = 2500+1100+1400=5000
Discuss: Why do both methods give the same result?
“Services are provided by doctors, teachers, lawyers, bankers, IT sector, etc.
but since they do not produce any tangible goods, how should their services be
included in the GDP? So, in the case of services, the income earned by the
constituents of this sector is added to the GDP.
It makes sense only to include the value added at each stage or to take the value
of final goods and services. The value of final goods and services produced in each
sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that
year. And the sum of production in the three sectors gives what is called the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. It is the value of all final goods and services
produced within a country during a particular year.
You might have noticed that the GDP figures are given for the year 2013-14.
This means the figures are pertaining to April 2013 to March 2014. This period is
also called the financial year.
GDP records the market value of all final goods and services produced. But
there are many items that are not sold/ purchased in the market. One important
example is the work that is done at home like cooking, cleaning, organizing, bringing
up children, tending to plants and cattle etc. In most instances, these do not involve
any monetary transaction and therefore remain outside the GDP measure, though
they are extremely important for the economy. Also, the unpaid work is done mostly
by women even today, in India and across the globe.
The value of GDP is given in the following table. Compute the growth rate of GDP as

produced and employment of people

So far, we know how the size of GDP has increased over the years, as more and
more goods and services are produced. It is essential to know how this increase
took place and what kind of activities contributed more to this growth of GDP. It
has been noted that many of the now developed countries had agriculture and other
allied activities as the most important contributor of GDP during the initial stages
of development.
As the methods of farming changed and agriculture sector began to prosper, it
produced much more food than before. Many people could now take up other
activities, as essential food requirements were met by other producers. There were
increasing number of craft-persons and traders. Buying and selling activities
increased many times, further increasing the demand for goods and services.
Besides, rulers employed large number of people as administrators, army etc.
However, at this stage, in an overall context, most of the goods produced were
from agriculture and related sector and most people were also employed in this
sector.
Recall what you have read about the industrial revolution in the earlier classes.
As new methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started
expanding. Those people who had earlier worked on farms now began to work in
factories in large numbers. People began to use many more goods. There was mass
production by factories at much lower rates and these goods reached the markets
all over the world. For these countries, industrial production gradually became the
most important sector, both in the total production of goods and services and also
in the employment of people. Hence, over time, a shift took place. This means that
the importance of the sectors had changed. The industrial sector became the
dominant sector and the importance of the agriculture sector both for employment
and production declined.
In the past 50 years, there has been a further shift from industry to service
sector for developed countries. The service sector has become the most important
sector in terms of total production. Most of the working people have also made a
shift and are now employed in the service sector and most of the production
activities are those of services and not manufactured goods. This is the general
pattern observed in developed countries. Is a similar pattern observed in India too?
Look at the following 2 pie charts on the next page. The contribution of various
activities to GDP has been presented for two financial years – 1973-74 and 20132014. The circle or the pie represents the GDP in the given year. GDP is made up
of production from the three sectors – agriculture, industry and services. Services,
in turn, are seen to comprise of three types.

The Gross Domestic Product of a country has a close relationship with the
total number of working people in that country. In every country, as population
increases, it is essential that the country provides opportunities for those who are
looking for work. Unless people get jobs to earn, how do they get food and other
necessities to fulfill their requirements?
According to the Census of India 2011, out of 1210 million persons in India,
460 million people are workers i.e. people engaged in some productive activities.

It means that there are more people in agriculture but everyone may not be
fully occupied. So, even if a few people move out, production will not be affected.
In this way, more number of people are engaged than required in agriculture. This
is called as disguised unemployment.
Take the case of a small farmer, Gayathri, who owns about two hectares of
unirrigated land, dependent only on rain and growing crops like jowar and redgram.
All five members of her family work on the plot throughout the year. Why? They
have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none
remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing
some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of people who are
underemployed, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to
work less than their potential. This kind of underemployment is hidden in contrast
to someone who does not have a job and is clearly visible as unemployed.
Supposing, a landlord hires one or two members of the family to work on his
land. Gayathri’s family is now able to earn some extra income through wages. Since
you do not need five people to look after that small plot, two people moving out
does not affect production on their farm. In the above example, two people may
move to work in a factory, or trade. Once again, the earnings of the family would
increase and they would also continue to produce as much from their land.
There are lakhs of farmers like Gayathri in India. This means that even if several
people from agricultural sector are provided with proper work elsewhere,
agricultural production will not suffer. The incomes of the people who take up
other work would increase the total family income.
This underemployment can also happen in other sectors. For example, there
are thousands of casual workers in the service sector in urban areas who search for
daily employment. They are employed as painters, plumbers, repair persons and
others doing odd jobs. Many of them don’t find work every day. Similarly, we see

While service sector has grown, all service sector activities are not growing
equally well. Service sector in India employs many different kinds of people. At
one end, there are a limited number of services that employ highly skilled and
educated workers. At the other end, there are a large number of workers engaged in
services such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transport persons, etc. These
people barely manage to earn a living and yet they perform these services because
no alternative opportunities for work are available to them. Hence, only a part of
this sector is growing in importance.

Organised and unorganised sector employment in India
So far, we have seen how different sectors contribute to Gross Domestic
Product of India and also realised the comparative importance of the three sectors.
This helps us to analyse the shifts that take place or don’t take place for both
production and employment.
For our country, we don’t see substantial shift in employment and to explore
this, we use another method of classification focusing on the nature of employment.
The classification discussed below emphasizes the problems of employment and
the associated conditions of work even more starkly.

Rajeshwari is working as a construction
worker. She goes for work at 7 am and returns
home at 7 pm. She travels about 8 to 10
kilometres daily for work by bus. Construction
workers get one hour lunch break between 1
pm and 2 pm. She gets work only for 10 to 12
days a month. On the remaining days, she has
no work, and she does not get any wages. She
gets Rs 150 per day as wages. Mostly she is
paid the wages on the same day in the evening.
When she works for three or four days at the
same day, she is paid after the work is completed. She gets more work from February to June. July to January is unseasonal.
Rajeshwari is a member of a Self Help Group in her locality. The government will
pay some compensation in case of death or major injury while she is at work.
There is no help from the government for the treatment in accidents while working. She is also a part of a group that works under a mason. There are 6 to 10
workers under each mason.
Narasimha and Rajeshwari are illustrative examples of workers employed in
organised and unorganised sectors respectively. Do you see the difference in their
conditions of work? The distinction between organised and unorganised sectors
helps us to understand the working situation and wages recieved by the majority of
workers in the country. 92 per cent of workers in India are found in unorganised
sector and only 8 percent find work in the organised sector.

Organised sector covers those enterprises or places of work where the terms
of employment are regular and therefore, people have assured work. They are
registered by the government and have to follow its rules and regulations which
are given in various laws such as the Factories Act, Minimum Wages Act, Shops
and Establishments Act etc. It is called organised sector because it has some formal
processes and procedures. Workers in the organised sector enjoy security of
employment. They are expected to work only for a fixed number of hours. If they
work more, they have to be paid overtime by the employer. They also get several
other benefits from the employers. They get paid leave, payment during holidays,
provident fund etc. They are supposed to get medical benefits and under the laws,
the employer has to ensure facilities like drinking water and a safe working
environment. When they retire, many of these workers get pensions as well. People
who work in the government or with companies or large establishments are all in
the organised sector.
The unorganised sector is characterised by small and scattered units which
have remained largely outside the control of the government. There are rules and
regulations but these are not followed or enforced. Jobs here are low-paid and not
regular. There is no provision for overtime, paid leave, holidays, leave due to
sickness etc. Employment is not secure. People can be asked to leave without any
reason. When there is less work during some seasons, some people may be asked
to leave. A lot also depends on the whims of the employer or changes in the market
situation.
Besides the above mentioned categories this sector includes a large number
of people who are employed on their own – self employed. Almost half the workers
are self employed. You would find them everywhere, doing small jobs such as
selling in the streets or doing repair work or as hawkers. Similarly, farmers are
largely self employed and also hire labourers as and when they require.
The organised sector offers jobs that are most sought-after. But the employment
opportunities in the organised sector have been expanding very slowly. As a result,
a large number of workers are forced to enter the unorganised sector jobs which
pay a very low salary. They are often exploited and not paid a fair wage. Their
earnings are low and not regular. When workers lose their jobs in the organised
sector, they are forced to take up jobs in the unorganised sector with low earnings.
Besides the need for more work, there is also a need for protection and support of
the workers in the unorganised sector.
Who are these vulnerable people who need protection? In the rural areas, the
unorganised sector mostly comprises of landless agricultural labourers, small and
marginal farmers, sharecroppers and artisans (such as weavers, blacksmiths,
carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly 80 per cent of rural households in India are in
small and marginal farmer category. These farmers need to be supported through
adequate facilities for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage

facilities and marketing outlets. As farm labourers, they require adequate work and
payment of minimum wages.
In the urban areas, unorganised sector comprises mainly of workers in smallscale industry, casual workers in construction, trade and transport etc. and those
who work as street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, rag pickers etc.
Small-scale industry also needs government’s support for procuring raw material
and marketing of output. The casual workers in both rural and urban areas need to
be protected.
Majority of workers from scheduled castes, tribes and backward communities
find themselves in the unorganised sector. It is worse if one is a woman from these
communities. Besides getting the irregular and low paid work, these workers also
face social discrimination. Protection and support to the unorganised sector workers
is thus necessary for both economic and social development.
Let’s examine both the production of goods and services and employment from
these sectors. The unorganised sector also contributes to GDP. During 2004-05,
the unorganised sector workers accounted for 92 per cent of all workers that
contributed half of all production. On the other hand, only 8% of people had a
decent employment and contributed 50% of the production of goods and services.
The products and services of these companies find a market but they support a very
small section of the population with privileged jobs. This is an extremely unequal
situation. The rest find only insecure low paying jobs or are self employed with
low earnings or remain underemployed.

How to create more and better conditions of employment?
A large number of people should have found a decent employment in industry
and services but this has not taken place. Production (in industry and services) has
increased without a similar increase in employment. When we look at how people
are employed, we find that most people are in the unorganised sector, barely able
to find work. The increase in production is benefitting only about 8% of workers.
Hence, in what ways can one increase employment for all people? Let us look at
some of them.

Take the case of Gayathri with her two-hectare plot of unirrigated land. The
government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan to construct a well
for her family to irrigate the land. Gayathri will then be able to irrigate her land and
take a second crop, wheat, during the rabi season. Let us suppose that one hectare
(2.5 acres) of wheat can provide employment to two people for 50 days (including
sowing, watering, fertiliser application and harvesting). So, two more members of
the family can be employed in her own field. Now suppose many small dams are
constructed and canals are dug to irrigate many such farms. This could lead to a lot
of employment generation within the agricultural sector itself reducing the problem
of underemployment.

AL

AN

G

Now, suppose Gayathri and other farmers produce much more than before.
They would also need to sell some of this. For this they may be required to transport
their products to a nearby town. If the government invests some money in
transportation and storage of crops, or makes better rural roads so that mini-trucks
reach everywhere several farmers like Gayathri who now have access to water, can
continue to grow and sell these crops. This activity can provide productive
employment to not just farmers but also others such as those in services like
transport or trade.

SC
ER
T,

TE

Gayathri’s need is not confined to water alone. To cultivate the land, she also
needs seeds, fertilisers, agricultural equipments and pumpsets to draw water. Being
a poor farmer, she cannot afford many of these. So she will have to borrow money
from moneylenders and pay a high rate of interest. If the local bank gives her credit
at a reasonable rate of interest, she will be able to buy all these in time and cultivate
her land. This means that along with water, we also need to provide cheap agricultural
credit to the farmers for farming to improve.
Another way by which we can tackle this problem is to identify, promote and
locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people
may be employed. For instance, many farmers decide to grow millets and other
cereals. Setting up a flour mill to procure and process these and sell in the cities is
one such example. Opening a cold storage could give an opportunity for farmers to
store their products like chillies and onions and sell them when the price is good.
In villages near forest areas, we can start honey collection centres where people
can come and sell wild honey. It is also possible to set up industries that process
vegetables and agricultural produce like tomato, chillies, mango, rice, red gram,
fruits, which can be sold in outside markets. This will provide employment in
industries located in semi-rural areas and not necessarily in large urban centres.

Climate and Weather
The state of atmospheric conditions of elements like sunshine, temperature,
atmospheric pressure, winds, humidity, clouds and precipitation over an area at a
particular time refers to weather. These weather conditions fluctuate very often
even in a short period. Climate refers to such conditions over a large area and
follows a similar general pattern over 30 or more years. There will be variations
from year to year but the basic pattern remains the same. On the basis of these
generalised conditions, the year is divided into seasons. The pattern of the elements
of weather and climate for a place can be shown using pictures called climographs

Factors influencing climate and weather

SC
ER
T,

It has been observed that for some places (e.g. Chennai), there is not much
difference in the temperature across months. Some places (e.g. Delhi) have wide
differences in temperature across the months. India experiences wide variations in
temperature. The northern portion is bound by the Himalayas whereas southern
peninsula is surrounded by seas. Some places are far from the coasts; they are
inland. Some places are at high altitude, whereas others are on the plains. The factors
that affect climate are called climatic controls. These include:
1. Latitude
2. Land-water relationship
3. Altitude
4. Upper air circulation

1. Latitude or distance from the equator

The average temperatures for the year drops as you go further away from the
equator. For this reason, we divide the regions on Earth as:
• Tropical, as those close to the Equator;
• Polar, as those close to the poles;
• Temperate, as those in between these two extremes.
If we compare the climate of, say, Indonesia and Japan, we can understand the
differences. The reason for their difference is the differential heating of Earth that

T,

Look at a map of India showing land
cover and water bodies and you will see
another important factor which has an
influence on climate: the land and water
relationship . The amount of sunlight that is
first absorbed and then radiated back or
directly reflected depends on the nature of
the surface. Darker areas such as heavily
vegetated regions, tend to be good absorbers;
lighter areas, such as snow and ice-covered
regions, tend to be good reflectors. The
ocean absorbs and loses heat more slowly
than land. This affects climate in many ways.
One of this is the formation of land and sea
breezes. Using Fig 4.2, explain how this
happens. Recall from class IX, the
connection between pressure and direction
of wind.

4. Upper atmospheric circulation

SC
ER
T,

In the northern hemisphere, subtropical high pressure belt gives rise to
permanent winds. They blow toward the equatorial low pressure belt by reflecting
towards the west and are called trade winds. The German word ‘trade’ means ‘track’
and stands for blowing steadily in the same direction and in a constant course. India
lies in the belt of dry north-east trade winds.

The climate of India is also affected by the movement of upper air currents
known as ‘jet streams’. These are fast flowing air currents in a narrow belt in the
upper atmosphere, above 12,000 m. The speed varies from about 110 km/h in summer
to about 184 km/h in winter. An easterly jet stream develops at about 250N latitude.
A jet stream causes the neighbouring atmosphere to cool. This cooling effect of
the easterly jet stream causes rain from clouds already found over this latitude
(250N).

Seasons: Winter
The temperature in the Indian land mass considerably reduces from midNovember and this cold season continues till February. January is usually the coldest
month - day temperature sometimes drops below 100C in several parts of the country.

Advancing monsoon
The climate of India is strongly influenced by the monsoon winds. The sailors
who came to India during olden days noticed the regular periodic reversal of winds.
They used these winds to sail towards the Indian coast. Arab traders named this
seasonal reversal of wind system as ‘monsoon’.
The monsoon forms in the tropical area approximately between 200 N and 200
S latitudes. The south-east monsoon winds from the southern hemisphere carry
moisture as they flow over the Indian Ocean and towards the equatorial low pressure
zones. After crossing the equator, these winds deflect towards the low pressure
formed in the Indian sub-continent. The heating of land creates low pressure on the

land mass of Indian sub-continent, especially over central India and the Gangetic
plain. Along with this, the Tibetan plateau gets intensely heated and causes strong
vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over the plateau at above 9
kms altitude.
They then flow as the southwest monsoon. The Indian peninsula divides them
into two branches - the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch. The Bay
of Bengal branch strikes the Bengal coast and the southern face of the Shillong
plateau. Then, it gets deflected and flows westward along the Gangetic valley. The
Arabian Sea branch arrives at the west coast of India and moves north ward. Both
the branches reach India by the beginning of June, which is known as the ‘onset of
monsoon’. They gradually spread over the entire country in four to five weeks. The
bulk of annual rainfall in India is received from south-west monsoon. The amount
of rainfall is very high along the west coast due to the Western ghats, and in northeast India due to the high peaked hills. Tamil Nadu coast (Coramandel), however,
remains mostly dry during this season as it is in the rain shadow area of the Arabian
Sea branch and is parallel to the Bay of Bengal branch.

Retreating Monsoon
October - November is a period of transition from hot wet conditions to dry
winter conditions. The retreat of the monsoons is marked by clear skies and rise in
temperature. The land is still moist. Owing to the conditions of high temperature
and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive. This is commonly known as
“October heat”.
The low pressure conditions which once prevailed over north-western India move
far South to the centre of the Bay of Bengal by early November. During this period,
cyclonic depressions are common which originate over the Andaman area. These
tropical cyclones are often very destructive. The thickly populated deltas of the
Godavari, Krishna and Cauveri are their targets. No year ever goes disaster free.
Occasionally, these tropical cyclones visit Sundarbans and Bangladesh too. Bulk of
the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast is derived from depressions and cyclones.

Global Warming and Climate Change

A

As Earth started to take its shape from a fire ball to a planet, many gases were
released. These gases did not escape into outer space because of the Earth’s
gravitational pull and it still holds them back. The result? A thin layer of gases
surrounds the Earth and provides us several important benefits. For example: the
oxygen that we breathe, the ozone that protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays
from the sun, the nitrogen that our plants use to make proteins that we need. This
layer of gases is the medium through which fresh water is circulated and it also
keeps us warm (take a look at the image from Class IX Chapter 4).

AN

G

AN

Keeping us warm is one of the most important things that the atmosphere does
for us. It is like a light, but effective, blanket enveloping Earth. You will recall from
Class IX that the atmosphere traps a lot of solar energy that reaches the Earth by
preventing it from totally escaping back into space. This is called Green House
Effect. This is important and vital for life to survive on this planet. If the Earth did
not have this atmosphere, it would be very cold indeed.

AL

However, since the 19th century, the planet has been warming up very rapidly.
There is an increasing concern about this. Why this concern? After all, Earth has
been through many cycles of warming and cooling (in fact, freezing!). So what is
so special about it now?

SC
ER
T,

TE

Earlier, cycles of cooling and warming happened over very long periods of
time. This allowed most of the life on Earth the time to adapt to the changes. The
problem now is that the heating is much more rapid and could lead to catastrophic
changes. Much of the warming that has been occurring since the Industrial Revolution
is because of human activities. Hence, the current global warming trend is called
AGW (Anthropogenic Global Warming; anthropogenic means caused by humans).
More recently, scientists are discovering large volumes of methane under the
frozen tundras of the far northern latitudes (mainly in the vast expanses of northern
Russia). As global temperature increases, the ice in the tundra melts more. The
methane that is trapped under the ice escapes into the atmosphere, increasing the
global temperatures. In turn, this causes even more ice to melt, releasing even
more methane and so on. Methane is said to be even more powerful than Carbon
dioxide as a greenhouse gas.

AGW and climate change
AGW is causing many changes in the distribution of heat in the Earth system.
Remember how atmospheric and oceanic circulations keep re-distributing the heat
in the world? AGW disturbs this and the re-distribution system. The disturbance
itself is not so much of a problem. It is the rapidity with which it is happening.
54

Social Studies

Climate of India

When the redistribution system is disrupted, weather and climate patterns
change. Long-term changes (climatic changes) happen from accumulations of
short-term changes (weather changes).

G

AN

A

An international effort to form an agreement whereby all countries try to reduce
their emission of greenhouse gases has so far not been achieved. An international
organization called Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
formed to address this issue. It has held many conferences to work out a treaty
among the nations of the world to reduce AGW and try to slow down the process
of climate change. None of these have been successful. The IPCC 2015 Paris
Summit came to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to
limit the rise in global average temperature to well below 20C above preindustrialisation level. On this agreement total 195 countries signed.

Broadly, the disagreements are between the ‘developed’ countries (mainly
industrialised, economically more advanced countries of the West) and ‘developing’
countries (countries that are not as industrialised). Developed countries want
developing countries to cut down on burning coal and other activities that add
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

Though a rise of 20 C in average temperature may appear to be small, it would
result in a rise of one meter in sea levels by early next century. This would affect
large portions of our coastal areas and millions of people would have to be shifted.
They would lose their livelihood.
Nearly 200 squatter families living in Nonadanga in east Kolkata for the past
few years are in the process of being evicted by the Kolkata Metropolitan
Development Authority (KMDA). Many of the families came to Kolkata in search
of work, after the ‘Aila super-cyclone’ ravaged Sundarbans in 2009.
On March 30, the slum was bulldozed amid heavy police presence and some
hutments were set on fire. The recurrent thunderstorms over the past few days
have meant sleepless and soiled nights for nearly 700 people who have been
rendered homeless. They work as house helps, rickshaw pullers and construction
labourers.
The other effect would be on rainfall. This is likely to be more erratic and lead
to greater imbalances: some places are likely to receive excess rainfall whereas
others would get less than normal. Hence droughts and floods are expected to
increase. This would affect the agriculture pattern and people’s livelihood to a
great extent.

The drainage system in India has evolved and adjusted itself with the evolution of
the three physiographic units: 1) the Himalayas 2) peninsular plateau and 3) the IndoGangetic plain. On the basis of its origin, the drainage system in India can be broadly
divided into two categories: i) The Himalayan rivers and ii) The Peninsular rivers.

The Himalayan Rivers

G

AN

A

The Himalayan Rivers belong to the three principal systems: the Indus, the
Ganga and the Brahmaputra. These rivers originate from almost the same region
within few kilometers of each other and are separated by water divides. They first
flow parallel to the main axis of the mountains. Then, they take a sudden bend
towards the south cutting through the massive mountain chain to reach the north
Indian plains. In the process, they have carved out deep ‘v’ shaped valleys. This is
well exhibited by the Indus and the Brahmaputra rivers.
The Himalayan Rivers are perennial. This is because the rivers are supplied on
rainfall as well as the melting snow.

Haridwar. The Ganga is joined by a
large number of tributaries. A majority of them originate in the Himalayan ranges
but some of them have their sources in the peninsular plateau.

The Brahmaputra System
The Brahmaputra (known as the Tsangpo in Tibet) rises from the snout of the
Chemayungdung glacier of the Kailas range near Manasarovar. It flows eastwards through
southern Tibet. Near Lhotse Dzong, it opens out into a wide navigable channel for
about 640 kms. Thereafter, the river breaks through a succession of rapids. It enters in
a great loop southwest through Arunachal Pradesh in India, first as the Siang and then as
the Dihang. Emerging into the Assam valley, it is joined by two tributaries-the Dibang
and the Lohit. From here, the river is known as the Brahmaputra.

flows through streams. During monsoon months, this surface flow would increase
substantially. A portion of the rainfall percolates into the soil and travels to the
underground strata and re-charges the aquifers. Some of it flows into and becomes
available for use through wells and bore wells and a portion of it

of the underground water becomes part of flows that eventually
appear in streams or rivers.

Water for agriculture: Water reaches the root zone of crops either through
rainfall or the process of irrigation. There’s a capacity of the soil to store moisture.
If there’s excess water, such as a flood, and this isn’t able to percolate below, it
would damage the roots. On the other hand, in a drought situation, if there isn’t
enough moisture in the root zone, the crops will wither/wilt.

Water use for domestic purpose and for animals: Water used for drinking,
cooking, washing, cleaning and for animals is vital. Planning is needed for this
component to increase the availability so that a minimum amount is actually made
available to all, irrespective of their income.

Water for industrial use: Water is required for manufacturing processes
and this demand often competes with domestic and agricultural uses. This needs to
be taken into account as this conflict is on the increase. The challenge areas that
industrial use face are recycling of water and control of pollution.

What is available to a region or a village does not only depend on the inflows
but also on what is already available as ‘stock’ that we use. We often have to keep
this distinction between stock and flow clear in our analysis. For example, imagine
a tank that is constantly being filled by an inlet pipe and water is also constantly
used by an outlet pipe. We can measure the inflow as the amount of water liters/
minute and the outflow similarly as the water liters/ min that flows out. The amount
of water in the tank keeps varying but at any one moment in time, say at 8.30 am,
we can measure the amount in liters. This is the stock of water at that time.

A village may have tanks, ponds, lakes, as surface storages. Most villages in
India draw water from wells and tube wells. They are dependent on ground water
storage. These inflows and storage are connected. While some of the water flowing
in is used directly, one part of this is recharging or replenishing the storage.
Similarly, the use of tube wells draws water from storages and lowers the water
available in them. Depending on comparative rates of inflow and outflow, we can
judge what is happening to the stock of water over many years. The question that
we face today is the depletion of ground water storages and a tendency not to care
about the availability for future generations.
The annual flows and stocks that recharge wells and tube wells is the water that
is available for use. We should keep our needs in this range. When we dig into
deeper aquifers - this is like mining water that has collected over thousands of
years. This is to be done only in extreme drought situations and replenished in
good rainfall years. We will come back later to this question of ‘sustainability’.

Case study of water used and conflict - the Tungabhadra river basin :
This is the case study to illustrate that water sharing among states and among
different user groups is a major issue for our country. How should we resolve such
conflict and be fair/just to all?

Water use in the Tungabhadra river basin
Tungabhadra, shared by the three southern states, Karnataka, Telangana and
Andhra Pradesh, is a tributary of the larger river system Krishna. It originates in
the Western Ghats with a catchment area of 71,417 km2, of which 57,671 km2 are

in Karnataka, and 2) the lower portion of the catchment in Telangana & Andhra
Pradesh.

AN

According to official statistics, farmland is the main land cover in these states.
Others such as trees, groves, fallow land, cultivable waste, permanent pastures,
forests and natural vegetation cover the rest of the area. Some of the territory is
used for storage by water harvesting systems called tanks. The lower portions of
the basin in Telangana & Andhra Pradesh are characterised by lower rainfall and
drought conditions. Some regions depend on rainfall and underground water (wells
and tube wells). Other areas depend on surface flows by canals that carry water
from dams built along Tungabhadra. There is a lot of difference in water availability
between these two types of regions.

under cultivation at the expense of tree cover.
Rampant felling of trees and mining activity result in forest degradation along with
the destruction of the habitat of highly threatened flora and fauna. Inflows of
groundwater depend on the tree cover in the catchment areas. Inadequate tree cover
leads to water run-off at surface flow without getting a chance to recharge the
underground system. Moreover, this
also causes flash floods. If we wish to Fig 5.1 : Tungabhadra Dam Construction - 1952

several small reservoirs, traditional tanks and Tungabhadra reservoir.”
Conflicts between Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are generally
related to availablity of water for use. Water is a flow resource and its storage or
use upstream affects what is available to people downstream. Water is shared based
on agreements between state governments.

AN

Access to water is a precondition in this farmland area where 80% of the
population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods. Irrigation is provided
through canal systems, while in rainfed regions farmers extract groundwater through
bore wells. The major crops grown include paddy, jowar, sugarcane, cotton and
finger millet.

AL

AN

G

Although the area is ideal for semi-arid crops, the major crops grown demand
a lot of water (paddy and sugarcane). Cultivation of such crops throughout the
basin has dramatically altered the water sharing balance. When all the areas desire
water for these crops, conflict becomes inevitable. Hence, there is a significant
difference between farmers with access to land and irrigated water, and those without
access. For a fair use of water for all, a change in cropping pattern would have to
be encouraged throughout the basin.

During the last two decades, there has been an increasing trend in the number
of small towns and industrial areas. This has made the competing demands for
water more complex. While increased industrialisation and growth of urban areas
have improved standards of living for some, the same activities have caused pollution
especially by industrial units. There are 27 functioning large units and 2543 small
units in this river basin. They consume a large amount of water per day. Industries
were permitted to discharge effluents into the river but following public protests
in 1984 regarding discharge of molasses that killed fish on a large scale, laws were
enacted requiring industry to discharge only treated effluents. These laws are not
implemented forcefully. Hence, severe pollution of the river system continues.
There has been a mismatch between keeping pace with development activities
on various fronts and providing sanitation and drinking water supply for all sections
of society, both in small towns and rural areas. Some say that drinking water and
sanitation are basic needs and a minimum amount has to be provided irrespective
of the ability to pay for these. When we experiment with metered water, we have to
allow that a certain section of society would not be able to afford the water that
they must get as a basic requirement. A report for this river basin says, “…provision
of drinking water to townships is not planned well, particularly the small towns
have serious access and equity related issues, more so during summer.”

Thus, the socio-economic aspects are very
important for water use management. Conflicts
within communities in a region and across
sectors such as use for agriculture, industry or
drinking water are common. Apart from this,
interstate disputes between Karnataka and
combined Andhra Pradesh arise due to the transboundary nature of the river.

How would it help if there was a

for overall planning of water use?
What are the different conflicts in

Rational and equitable Use of water - an example

In different parts of India, we can see number of traditional methods of water
harvesting and rational use of water. We have read about the use of water and the
need to look at all the inflows and outflows so that a judicious and fair use of water
can be worked out. This could be for a river basin or a village. Such plans and
implementation schemes are possible. Hiware Bazar village is an example.
Hiware Bazar was selected under the Adarsh Gram Yojana of Maharashtra
government for watershed and all-round development of the village. Hiware Bazar
is located in Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. It is situated on the eastern
(rainshadow) side of the Sahayadri mountain ranges that run north-south and
separate Konkan, the coastal region, from the rest of Maharashtra. Ahmednagar
district is drought prone with an average annual rainfall of about 400 mm.
The soil and water conservation works in Hiware Bazar were implemented
on common lands and on private grasslands. Continuous contour trenches (CCTs)
were dug on the hill slopes to arrest the erosion of soil, harvest water and
encourage growth of grass. A number of water harvesting structures were also
built in the village - check dams, percolation tanks, and loose boulder structures.
Plantations on forest lands and roadsides were also part of the programme.
When Adarsh Gram Yojana was launched in Maharashtra, there were also
some pre-conditions set for selection of villages. Most important were the four
bandis (or bans) made famous by the Ralegaon Siddhi experience. The four bandis
were kurhad bandi (ban on felling trees), charai bandi (ban of free grazing),
nasbandi (family planning), and nashabandi (ban on liquor). People also had to
agree to a certain amount of shramdaan (voluntary physical labour), except for
the landless who were exempt from it.
The significance of these five ideals needs to be understood keeping in mind
the situation in Hiware Bazar at that time the late 1980s. Tree felling and open
grazing was common among both rich and poor households. The surrounding
hillocks, according to many local people, had a barren look, soil erosion was
prominent and groundwater levels very low. In addition to this, fodder and fuel
wood shortage were common in the village. Though there was a ban on free
grazing people were allowed to cut grass and carry it to feed animals.
66

There are other bans in the village which were added later. Most significant
was the ban on borewells for irrigation, growing sugarcane and banana and selling
one’s land to any outsider. These measures illustrate that issues of long-term
sustainability (especially in terms of water use) were very much central to the
strategy. The bandis were not mere proclamations but ways of community
building aimed at people identifying with the common purpose. But it was not
always a smooth affair.

The area irrigated for summer crops has increased from 7 to 72 hec. In a year
of normal rainfall, there is enough water in the wells to irrigate not only the
kharif bajra, but also the rabi jowar and some summer vegetable crops. Even in
unirrigated land, the improvement in soil moisture level has helped to increase
productivity. The range of crops is also considerably more diverse than in the
past with people growing cash crops such as potatoes, onions, fruits (grapes and
pomegranates), flowers, and wheat. Perhaps the most significant development
is that increased water availability has made a second crop possible and hence
migration elsewhere has reduced. Although this has not meant that small and
marginal farmers are able to eke out a living on their own lands only, it has made
their lands much more productive. The conditions of wage employment have
also improved with wage rates going up – though they remain on the low side.

The main thing is the social control over ground water extraction and use –
no borewells for irrigation (only for drinking water), no water- intensive crops
like sugarcane. Water for irrigation should be taken only through dug wells. They
have also worked out certain thumb rules like if they get good rainfall then they
can take full rabi crop, if the rainfall is less then they bring down the area under
rabi etc. They keep rainfall data meticulously and use it for crop planning and
water use prioritisation. Because of this, even in years of continuous drought,
there was no drinking water shortage. This is mainly because they plan according
to the water available.

The improvement of the livestock economy has also helped marginal and
small farmers significantly. Concerted efforts have been made to promote Hiware
Bazar’s dairy industry as a means to improve the livelihood of all. Loans have
been given to many small farmers. As a result, the number of milch animals in
the village has increased. These developments are clearly linked to the fact that
fodder availability has increased due to better productivity. Milk production in
the village has also witnessed a more than 20 fold increase from 140 to 3,000
litres per day.

Water as common pool resource
Over the past few decades, groundwater has become the main source of water
especially for domestic use and agriculture. This tremendous increase in the use of
groundwater has significant impact on water availability and access to it.
The current laws about groundwater in many states are both outdated and
inappropriate. They were developed at a time when groundwater was a marginal
source of water. Today, shallow and deep tube wells have the potential to draw a lot
of water. What should be the judicious way of using this water?
Current laws on ground water use are inappropriate because the basic link
between access to groundwater and land ownership on which these rules are based
are flawed. Since groundwater has to be extracted from the land above, a link was
established between land ownership and control. The water drawn from the
68

underground system was assumed to be ‘owned’ by the landowner. This implies
that groundwater is mostly controlled by individuals that own the land. Land owners
were not restricted in the amount of water they can take out.
Why is the above understanding flawed? Underground water does not obey
human land ownership boundaries that are made on the surface. Water is a flowing
resource and what is extracted from an individual tube well or well depends on the
underground rock formation, the recharge from rainfall or surface water. All these
factors are happening over a large area. Hence, the actions of others in the region
will affect this particular well. For example, over-extraction from one tube well
often dries up other tube wells around. Each one competes to go deeper than their
neighbour and soon all the tube wells up to a certain depth dry up, since these wells
are interconnected by the underground structures in the region. It is therefore
inappropriate to think of ‘ownership’ of a flowing resource such as water. Compare
this to the air over the plot of land - it is always flowing and there is no way one can
create boundaries. Similarly, there are no boundaries in the flowing water
underground.
Today, this is the major source of water for people. When there is so much
extraction, it affects others in connected areas. It affects the stock of water that
would be available for future generations. Therefore, one can’t allow individual
landowners to extract as much water as they wish from their land. There should be
some restrictions. These restrictions will be acceptable if we first delink the
connection between ownership of land and water drawn from the underground
system through tube wells on the land.
Where control over groundwater is linked to land rights, there are no pressures
on individual landowners to use water in a fair manner. Nor is there any way to
implement policies that take into account the welfare of a broader community and
the environment. For instance, in an unregulated system, there is no authority that
can determine how many wells, handpumps and other tubewells can be sunk in a
given area. Some form of regulation that takes into account the broader aspects of
groundwater use is necessary. Therefore, water should be thought of as a collective
pool resource that is meant for all people. Similar to roads, rivers, and parks,
underground water is also a ‘public property’, it belongs to all. While this is being
recognised today by some state governments, it has still not become widespread.
Regulation is not easy. This is also because for some resources like water,
electricity, oil, natural gas etc consumption by one person or a sector affects what
is available for others. In fact, in a number of states, the answer to falling water
tables has not been to address the issue itself. State governments have thus often
chosen to increase power subsidies to make extraction of ever deeper layers of
groundwater possible. The limits of an approach that not only refuses to control
access to groundwater but seeks to encourage it with specific subsidies have been
clearly understood. The political thinking has to change to make these regulation

work. This is the only way to stop the negative competition to finish off the common
pool resource since each person wants their share before someone else does. This
is the real contemporary challenge.
What is required are laws and rules to recognise that water is a common flowing
resource. Drinking water is the first priority as well as a human right and that
panchayati raj institutions must have control over the use of groundwater.
Let us see the dispute over water use between the Perumatty Grama
Panchayat in Kerala and the Coca Cola Company. The Panchyat decided not to
renew the license for extraction of water because of the lowering of the water
table in neighbouring areas. There was also decreasing water quality to the extent
that the local government primary health centre had concluded that the water
was not fit for drinking. The issue was brought to the courts and is now pending
in the Supreme Court as on January 2014. The two decisions given by the judges
in Kerala gave two opposing views of groundwater regulation. The first judge
found that groundwater is a public resource meant for all and that the state has
a duty to protect it against excessive exploitation. Additionally, the judge made
the link that drinking water is a priority. The second judge took a completely
different perspective and asserted the primacy of landowners’ control over
groundwater. These two contradictory decisions illustrate the confusion over our
laws today.

The age structure of a population refers to the number of males and females
in different age groups in a country. It is one of the most basic characteristics of a
population. To an important degree, a person’s age influences what she requires,
her capacity to work, whether she is dependent on others etc. Consequently, the
number and percentage of children in a population, people of working age, and
aged persons are notable determinants of the population’s social and economic
structure.
The population of a nation is generally grouped into three broad categories:
1. Children (generally below 15 years) : They are taken care of by the
family and like everyone else, they require food, clothing, education and medical
care and all other opportunities for growth. However, usually they do not earn their
income to support themselves. It is not desirable that some children are forced to
work because of their economic conditions.
2. Working Age (15-59 years) : Usually this group forms the working
population in a society. They are also biologically reproductive. Most people in
this age group desire decent income and security of work. Children and the aged
often depend on the earnings of this group.

men and women in a society.
Graph 2 : India Population : Sex Ratio, 1951 - 2011
You have calculated this for the
families that you surveyed.
Now, examine these figures for
the country as a whole.
We notice that the number
of females in India has
consistently been lower than
that of males. It is a cause of
concern since it indicates a
hidden form of discrimination. Women and girls in particular face unequal
opportunities for education and development. They are discriminated against in
the most basic needs of nutrition, child care and health also – they get less of
these things as compared to males. This often happens within the family. Yes, this
discrimination is not always obvious.

SC
ER
T,

Medical research shows that given similar circumstances, girl children survive
much better than boys. Hence, if there was no discrimination, the number of girls
should be higher or as much as boys. The census 2011 shows that in the age group
0-6, sex ratio was 919, as the number of girls who survive is much lower than
boys. This happens due to discrimination in their care and nutrition and female
infanticide.
The other evidence that we have is from comparative figures. If we look at
societies or regions that have provided equality to women and provided equal
opportunities for them, the sex ratios are different. Regions that have unequal
gender relations that favour the males and discriminate against the females tend
towards unequal sex ratios. This can happen even though they have high incomes.
For example, look at the following data:

It is noted that within India certain
parts like Kerala have a positive sex
ratio while some other regions are
extremely biased against women. A
distressing aspect of gender bias in
India that shows little sign of going
away is the preference for boys over
girls. One of the worst manifestations
of this pro-male bias is the relatively
higher mortality rates of girls
compared with boys. This is mainly
because of the quiet violence of the
neglect of their health and illness in
comparison with the attention that
male children receive. There has also
been the case of female selective
abortion. Due to the preference for
male children, parents may decide to
abort the female child before birth.
Many families consider female
children as a burden. Studies have
shown that the priority, for male
children in health continues for adults,
raising the mortality rates of even adult
women above those of adult men.
Women’s education has been a
powerful force in reducing
discrimination against women. There is
definitive evidence that women’s
literacy and schooling reduces child
mortality and work against the selective
neglect of the health of girls. To
understand such situations, discuss the
questions on the right and whether this
would impact the sex ratio.

Changing population size

Population is dynamic. The numbers, distribution and composition of the
population are always changing. This is because of the interaction of the three
processes: (1) births, (2) deaths and (3) migrations.
Change in the size of a population is the difference in the number of inhabitants
of a country/ territory during a specific period, say during the last ten years. Such
a change can be expressed in two ways: (1) as absolute numbers or (2) as percentage
change.
The absolute numbers added each decade is the magnitude of increase. It is
obtained by simply subtracting the earlier population (e.g. that of 2001) from the
later population (e.g. that of 2011). If the result is a positive number, the population
has increased. If it is a negative number, the population has decreased by that number.
Population change (absolute numbers) = (population at later date) – (population
at earlier date)

Population change in a place = (number of births + number of in-migrants) –
(number of deaths + number of out-migrants). A positive number means the
population has increased by that number. A negative number shows that it has
decreased by that number.

SC
ER
T,

TE

Assume for the moment that there is no migration. In order to calculate these
increases we examine two rates. (1) Birth rate is the number of live births per
thousand persons in a year. In 1992, the birth rate in India was 29. This means that
for every 1000 people living in the country during that year, 29 live births took
place. (2) Death rate is the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year. In the
year 1992, for every 1000 persons living at that time, 10 people died during the
year. Therefore, 19 people for every 1000 was the addition during the year. This
number can be expressed as a percentage i.e. 1.9%. Hence, we say that the population
growth rate was 1.9% for the year 1992.
The rate or the pace of population increase is important. It is studied in per
cent per annum. For example a rate of increase of 2 per cent per annum means that
in a given year, there was an increase of two persons for every 100 persons in the
base year. This is calculated year by year like in compound interest. This is referred
to as the annual growth rate. India’s population has been steadily increasing.
In order to examine the causes for the growth of Indian population, as seen
from the graph above, we need to look at both death rate and birth rate. There has
been a rapid decline in the death rate but till recent times, birth rate has not been
decreasing substantially. The period 1901-21 witnessed high death rates due to
famines, epidemics including influenza epidemic of 1918 that is estimated to have
killed 15 million people. From 1921 onwards and especially post independence,

impact of famines declined because of famine relief, movement of grain, ration
shops and an active public voice in a democracy. Similarly, epidemics such as
cholera, plague and to some extent malaria have also been controlled. Polluted
water, congested living and un-cleared garbage were the real causes of several
diseases. These causes have to be met with better sanitation, clean water and
nutrition and several steps have been initiated. Later on advances in medicine,
especially antibiotics and vaccines contributed to better health care. Compared to
1921, death rates fell rapidly. High birth rates along with declining death rate led
to higher rate of population growth.

G

AN

Why did birth rate remain high for such a long period? One set of reasons has
to do with what has happened in the past. If in the overall population, the percentage
of young people is high, then in the coming years they would grow up, get married
and have children. The total number of such children added each year would be
high because we began with a population with a large number of young people.

AN

The other reason is the number of children that couples wish to have. This in
turn is related to how many children survive, what social security people have and
the preference for a male child in society.

TE

AL

You could inquire in your family and compare across three or four generations
the number of children who survive. You are likely to find that when family sizes
were large, it was also because the number of children who survived was uncertain.
Many died during childbirth or in the early years of infancy. Medical services and
assured nutrition was not always available. Together with this the preference for
male children was strong leading to large family sizes. These factors are changing.

Since 1981, birth rate had also started declining gradually, resulting in a gradual
decline in the rate of population growth. Calculate the % of change over the decades
1951 to 2011 and see if this is happening in the table above.

AN

G

How do we understand this trend? We use another concept called the Fertility
rate (total births per woman). Total fertility rate is the number of children that is
are probable to be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing
years and bear children in accordance with current patterns. If this declines, then
we can say that couples are deciding to have fewer children. Factors both within
the family and outside are contributing to these decisions. Examine the Graph 4.

SC
ER
T,

TE

AL

The fertility rate for India in 1961 was 5.9, which indicates that on an average
each woman was likely to bear five or six children. The family decides the number
of children they want depending on security, opportunities for children and social
norms. There have been some changes in this outlook. Present fertility rate in
India is 2.7, in combined Andhra Pradesh fertility rate is 1.9.

The third component of population change is migration. Migration is the
movement of people across regions and territories. Migration can be internal
(within the country) or international (between the countries). Internal migration
does not change the size of the population, but influences the distribution of
population within the nation. Migration plays a very significant role in changing
the composition and distribution of population. You will learn more about migration
in the forthcoming chapter.

We often hear people talk of population growth in alarmed tones. These people
are often literate and talk about others not benefitting because there are too many
people who have to share very few resources. However, families decide the number
of children they want to have based on many considerations such as the resources
they own, their security in old age etc. Most often, families with larger number of
children are poorer than the rest, don’t own many assets, and rely on their children
for old age security. How do we understand these different points of view?

AL

Population density

Population density provides a better picture of its distribution. Population
density is calculated as the number of persons per unit area.

SC
ER
T,

TE

India is one of the most densely populated countries of the world. The
population density of India in the year 2011 was 382 persons per sq km. Densities
vary from 1102 persons per sq km in Bihar to only 17 persons per sq km in
Arunachal Pradesh. Assom and most of the peninsular states have moderate
population densities. Hilly, dissected and rocky nature of the terrain, moderate to
low rainfall, shallow and less fertile soils have influenced population densities in
these areas. The Northern Plains and Kerala in the south have high to very high
population densities because of the flat plains with fertile soils and abundant
rainfall.
Identify the three states of the Northern Plains with high population densities.
How does the density of population vary so much? We have to examine the history
of the region, the terrain and climatic conditions to be able to understand this
variation. For example, read the section on ‘Land and other natural resources’ in
chapter 8. Even though fertile land and irrigation is able to support a larger
population than before, the impact on each group is different, especially for small
farmers and landless labourers.

Settlements change for
many reasons. Read the
following story about Delhi.

AN

G

AN

A

The city of Delhi can claim to
have been central to many
empires that ruled India. When
India gained independence, the
city remained its capital. Over the
Fig 7. 3 : A middle class housing colony.
decades, the city has attracted
people from all parts of India as they migrated in search of livelihood, jobs, education,
dispensary etc. As the capital of the country, with the Parliament and Central
Government offices, there are people from all parts living in the city. Because of this,
the population increased, i.e. more than two times.

SC
ER
T,

TE

AL

Every city usually has a master plan to design and allocate different types of
areas. In any city, there should be housing areas, markets, schools, industrial areas,
office areas, parks and recreational areas and so on. Based on this, planners can
decide the types of roads, the amount of water or electricity required, how to
dispose waste, how to clean sewage etc that would be necessary. The city of Delhi
had three such master plans. However, if we look at the current scenario, it would
appear that these plans have not been implemented properly. In fact, Delhi has
grown in an unplanned manner. A planned colony usually has all the facilities in
place. Government has to announce areas demarcated for different purposes.
The constructions in that area are expected to follow such an order. However, it is
clear that such plans have not been followed.
On one hand, there is growing population in the cities and on the other hand,
there is long delay in planning and announcing how the areas are to be used.
People who migrate to the city looking for work, occupy land and settles, often
without necessary permission and build on it in the way they can afford with no
help or facility from anyone. They remain unauthorised for long periods. When
the plan is finally announced, these areas may be marked for a different purpose.
This leads to a difficult conflict situation. People face constant threat of eviction.
They seek political patronage from being evicted from their homes. These colonies
are not likely to be recognised because the master plan ignored their existence.
Thus these colonies also do not receive many public amenities. People here are
poor but they have built the city and continue to provide essential services to the
city.

Social Studies

Settlements - Migrations

What type of places are formed as settlements?
To understand this, we need to look at these basic concepts: (1) site (2) situation
(3) the history of the place.

AN

A

Site refers to the characteristics of
the place – its topography, altitude,
characteristics of water bodies like lakes,
rivers, underground water, types of soils,
security, shelter from natural forces, and
so on.

AL

AN

G

In early settlement periods, places
which had favourable water supply and
good protection from invasions were
preferred. For example, Chhatrapati
Fig 7.4 : Fort in Pratapgad
Shivaji built a fort in Pratapgadh,
Maharashtra. This site was chosen because of its altitude from where all the
surrounding areas could be seen. This provided military security.

TE

Places do not exist in isolation. They are in some way connected to other places.
Situation describes the connections with other places. For example: Visakhapatnam
is located on the coast and connects to many places in and outside of India.

SC
ER
T,

Over the decades, Visakhapatnam’s population has grown significantly (see next
table 2). This growth is a result of the importance of Visakhapatnam as a port city.
This population increase also indicates growth in economic and social opportunities.
Visakhapatnam has a long history. It was ruled by different dynasties during precolonial times. During
the 19th century, the
British and French fought
a naval battle over this
city. Coastal places were
of immense significance
for colonial powers
because they could build
ports there. These ports
would enable export of
raw materials to the
Fig 7. 5 : Visakhapatnam
colonising country.

In fact, cities such as Mumbai and Chennai were further developed by the
colonial powers to better exploit the natural resources of India. The fight for
Visakapatnam was for similar reasons.

Urbanisation in India

G

AN

A

In India, nearly 350 million i.e. one-third of
population lives in cities and towns. People have
been increasingly taking up non agriculture work
and living in cities and towns. This process is called
urbanisation. A considerable section of population
in the 1950s lived in 5.6 lakh villages and there
were only 5 cities that had a population of more
than 1 million each and the number of cities with
1 lakh population was around 40. As per 2011 Fig 7.6 : Residential area of Low income people
in Delhi
census, the number of villages has increased to
6.4 lakhs and about 850 million people live in these villages. Three cities – Mumbai,
Delhi and Kolkata - accommodate more than 10 million people each. There are
more than 50 cities that have a population of 1 million and above.

TE

AL

AN

Though there has been an increase in urbanisation, the basic infrastructure that
can support this growth is grossly insufficient. You require roads, drainage,
electricity, water and other public facilities. Government intervention is making
some headway in improving the urban infrastructure particularly those associated
with road transport. However, the provision of electricity, water and health
infrastructure is not sufficient. For poorer people in the cities and towns, this
situation is even worse.

SC
ER
T,

How does urban India contribute to India’s economic development? Service
sector activities such as information technology, finance, insurance, real estate and
business related service activities such as transport, storage and communication
contribute more than industrial activities. There is no major growth of industrial
output over the last few decades. Most of the output comes from service activities.
Living in or moving into cities and towns is a boon only for a few. Although the
level of poverty in urban areas is relatively lower than what is noticed in rural areas,
there is a huge gap between the average income of a low income family and a high
income family. This gap has also been increasing in cities and towns. Incomes earned
in urban areas by the SC/ STs are far lower than other caste groups. In 2009-10, only
about one-sixth of urbanites belonging to castes other than SC/ STs were poor whereas
in the case of SC/ ST urbanites the poverty level is double. Most of these poor live
in non metropolitan towns and work in the unorganised sector.
Most of the population increase in cities and towns took place as a consequence
of natural growth within the urban areas. The population of these urban areas
increased over time. Some of the growth in urban settlements took place by
expansion, with the inclusion of rural areas surrounding older cities and towns.
Only one-fifth of the growth is due to rural - to - urban migration.

Problems of Urbanisation

G

AN

A

Increasing urbanisation is not just all about greater opportunities for people,
more economic productivity, etc. It also results in many problems. The growing
urban population has to be housed. It needs water supply, sewage and other waste
disposal, transportation and many other things. All these result in environmental
stress. As vehicle use increases, urban air pollution increases, causing health
problems and localised climatic change. Improper sewage disposal can also lead to
greater threat of infectious diseases.
One of the impacts of increased urbanisation is the use of materials that either
do not degrade or take a long time to do so. This produces waste that has to be
disposed off. Where do we put such waste? As urban areas expand, the waste is
increasingly pushed to rural areas where they are either just dumped or taken to
waste treatment plants.

as migrants. Migrations can happen due to many reasons. While females report
marriage as the most common reason for migration, employment or seeking
employment is the most common reason for males to migrate. Dissatisfaction
with employment opportunities in the native place, better opportunity for studies,
losses in business, family feuds etc are also some of the other reasons that people
have stated as reasons for migration in the census surveys.

According to the national census surveys, every fourth person in India is a
migrant. During 2001-2011, migration increased but not as much as in the 1980s.
This may be within a state or outside. We have examined the statistics of rural –
urban migration and the multiple reasons for migration. However, it is significant
to note that rural to rural migration is increased. Some of this may not be captured
by census data because the period of stay is often less than six months. The number
of seasonal migrants is underestimated in India due to limitations in the definition
of the term ‘migrant’ used in the national surveys.

in the early 1970s after the Koina dam was built. A study estimates that about
6,50,000 labourers migrate from central to western Maharashtra for sugarcane
cutting each year. Of these, around 2,00,000 are children in the school age group

Many families have residences both at their origin (native place) and at the
destination. They shift between the two places depending on work and seasons.
Migration does not necessarily involve movement of all members of the family,
and often the wife remains in the rural area.
Urban migrants use different job searching mechanisms depending upon their
skills and educational qualifications. Contacts and networks are crucial for getting
urban jobs. In fact, villagers pre-arrange their jobs from rural areas and come to
urban areas through their contacts or networks. They keep close ties with their rural
areas for a variety of reasons. Migrants also pass on the urban opportunities to the
rural areas so that potential migrants can engage in rural-based job search. In most
cases, migration is the survival strategy for many families.

One-third of the world’s 200 million international migrants, less than 70 million
people, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have
moved from one developing country to another. International migration from India
is of two types:
People with technical skills and professional expertise have migrated to
countries such as USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other developed
countries. IT professionals, doctors and management professionals are an example
of this type. Indians migrating to countries such as UK and Canada in 1950s and
1960s were unskilled whereas in the later years, mostly professionals went to these
countries. In recent times, Indian professionals also go to countries such as Germany,
Norway, Japan and Malaysia. In the 1950s, about 10,000 persons a year went to
developed countries and in 1990s, this has increased to more than 60,000 a year.
The second type of international migration is unskilled and semi-skilled workers

all these workers come back after a specific period depending on the employment
situation in the destination countries. During the last few decades, Saudi Arabia and
UAE (United Arab Emirates) have been the importants destinations for most of the
3 million Indian workers in the West Asia. Every year, more than 3 lakh workers
migrate to West Asia. Nearly three-fifths of workers going to West Asia are from
Kerala, Tamil Nadu Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A considerable section of these
workers are engaged in construction projects, maintenance, services, transport and
telecommunications.

“Migrants who are unskilled and perform manual labor often face many hardships
in their countries of work. They spend more on food as they cannot get food grains
from fair price shops at their workplaces.”. As they live in harsh circumstances and
unhygienic conditions, they suffer from health problems and are prone to disease.
Those working in quarries, brick kilns, construction sites and mines suffer from
body ache, sun stroke, skin irritation and lung diseases. When employers do not
follow safety measures, accidents in industrial areas and construction sites are
also common. Migrants are not able to access various health and family care
programmes as they do not belong to the organised sector. In the case of women
migrant workers, there is no maternity leave. This means they have to go back to
work soon after childbirth.

When families migrate, children accompanying their parents do not have creche
facilities. Grown up children are not able to continue their studies at their parents’
new workplaces. Schools in their native place refuse to take them again when they
come back. They finally become dropouts. When males leave their families, it is
also a major challenge for women who have to take care of all the responsibilities
of the family and elderly people who need care. Young girls in such families are
required to take care of siblings and many of them become dropouts.
Migration leaves a considerable mark
on the migrants also. Exposure to different
environment, stress associated with it,
food available and social atmosphere leave
a deep impact on migrants. This also
depends on the length of migration.

back savings. Migration allows households to meet debts and other obligations
without having to sell assets. It is also common to find migrant families buying
house, land, agricultural machinery and consumer durables. Some migrants might
take up jobs in the destination, acquire skills required in the destination area, become
aware of how to get regular jobs and migrate regularly or permanently.

The Emigration Act, 1983 is the Indian law governing migration and employment
of Indians abroad. It also lays out conditions to safeguard the interests of workers
emigrating for employment. Embassies set up by the Indian Government in different
countries are expected to follow the legal procedures and protect the welfare of the
international migrants as given in the Emigration Act. At times, migrant workers are
not paid their salaries, recruitment agents cheat prospective workers or collect more
than the prescribed fees for their role in getting work for workers abroad. Employers
also terminate the job contract before its expiry, change the employment contract
to the disadvantage of migrant workers, pay less than the agreed salary and freeze
fringe benefits and other perks. They often force workers to do overtime without
making additional payments, and deny permission to keep one’s own passport. Indian
migrant workers seldom lodge any complaint against their foreign employers for
the fear of losing their jobs.

This story of a village will take us through the different types of production
activities in a village. In villages across India, farming is the main production activity.
The other production activities, referred to as non-farm activities, include small
manufacturing, transport, shop-keeping etc. Let us look at both the types of activities
in this chapter. The production systems - whether at a farm or a factory can be
analysed using some ideas of the essential elements in any production process.
How the production is organised in turn has an important bearing on people’s lives.
The story of Rampur village (name changed) is based on a detailed case study
where the writer went and stayed in the area and closely observed the various aspects
of life in the village. The study of the village was followed by subsequent visits. The
writer could therefore note many changes in the village across time. As you read the
story, you may want to think and enquire, about whether the phenomenon observed
for Rampur is also present in your area. Or is the situation different? If so, in what
ways?
In this chapter, you will come across occasional reference to your own situation
or the all-India situation. For instance, when we discuss distribution of land in
Rampur, we also examine what has happened to India as a whole. Interestingly, we
find that there are strong parallels. This helps us to understand that while Rampur

Farming in Rampur
Rampur lies in the fertile alluvial plains of the Gangetic
basin in the western part of Uttar Pradesh. Along with Punjab
and Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh forms a contiguous belt
of agriculturally prosperous region. The village is wellconnected with the neighbouring villages and cities. Raiganj,
a big village, is 3 kms from Rampur. An all weather road
connects Raiganj to the nearest small town Jahangirabad (12
kms away). Many kinds of transport are visible on this road
starting from bullock carts, tongas, bogeys (wooden cart

like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors and trucks.
Farming is the main production activity in Rampur. Majority of the working
people are dependent on farming for their livelihood. They could be farmers or
farm labourers. The well-being of these people is closely related to the production

Land is the most crucial factor necessary for farm production. Land area under
cultivation, however, is practically fixed. In Rampur, since 1921, there has been no
expansion in land area under cultivation. By then, the nearby forests had been
cleared and some of the wastelands in the village
were converted to cultivable land. There is no

consumption and sell the surplus at the market-yard
at Raiganj. A part of the land is used for sugarcane production which is harvested
once every year. Sugarcane, in raw form, or as jaggery, is sold to traders in
Jahangirabad, the nearby town.
Growing more than one crop on the same piece of land during the year is
known as multiple cropping. It is the most common way of increasing production
from land. All farmers in Rampur grow at least two main crops; many are growing
potato as the third crop.
Farmers in Rampur are able to grow three different crops in a year due to the
well-developed irrigation system. Electricity came early to Rampur. It transformed
the system of irrigation. Till then, Persian wheels were used by farmers to draw
water from the wells and irrigate small areas. People saw that the electric-run
tubewells could irrigate much larger areas of land easily. The first few tubewells
were installed by the government almost fifty years ago. Soon, however, farmers
started setting up their own tubewells. As a result, by mid-1970s, the whole of the
cultivated area of 264 hectares (ha.) was irrigated.
Not all villages in India have such high levels of irrigation. Apart from the
riverine plains, coastal regions in our country are well-irrigated. In contrast, plateau
regions such as the Deccan plateau have low levels of irrigation. Even today, a
little less than 40 percent of the total cultivated area in the country is irrigated. In

While intensive use of natural resources
like land and water has led to increased production and yields, the use of the natural
resources has not always been judicious. Experience shows fertility of land is
declining due to overuse-excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. The
situation of water is equally alarming. Like Rampur, mostly irrigation in India is
based on tapping underground water. As a result, underground water tables have
fallen rapidly across the country. Even in regions with bountiful rains and favourable
natural systems of recharge, the water tables have reached dangerously low levels.
As the water tables decline, farmers have to drill deeper tube wells than before.

You must have realised how important land is for farming. Unfortunately, not
all the people engaged in agriculture have sufficient land for cultivation. The
population of Rampur is about 2,660; there are about 450 families belonging to
different castes. The upper caste families own majority of the land in the village.
Their houses, some of them quite large, are made of brick with cement plastering.
The SCs (dalits) comprise 1/3rd of the population and live in more modest houses,
some portions of which may be thatched and are located in one corner, outside the
main village area.
In Rampur, about 1/3rd of the population, i.e. 150 families are landless. Most
of the landless families are dalits. There are 60 families of medium and large
farmers who cultivate more than 2 hectares of land. A few of the large farmers
have land extending over 10 hectares or more. About 240 families cultivate small
plots of land less than 2 hectares in size. Cultivation of such plots doesn’t bring
adequate income to the farmer families.
In 1960, Gobind was a farmer
with 2.25 hectares of largely
unirrigated land. With the help
of his three sons, Gobind
cultivated the land. Though they
didn’t live very comfortably, the
family managed to feed itself
with a little bit of extra income
from one buffalo that the family
possessed. Some years after
Gobind’s death, this land was
divided among his three sons.
Each one now has a plot of land
that is only 0.75 hectare in size.
Even with improved irrigation
and modern farming methods,
Gobind’s sons are not able to
make a living from their land.
They have to look for additional
work during part of the year.

Organisation of Production

Let us try to understand the overall process of production in Rampur.
The aim of production is to produce goods and services that people need.
Further, the producer requires a number of items to produce a good or service.
These can be classified as follows :
The first requirement is land and other natural resources such as water, forests,
minerals. We have read above how land and water are used for farming in Rampur.
The second requirement is labour i.e. people who do the work. Some
production activities require highly trained and educated workers to perform the
necessary tasks. Other activities require workers who can do manual work. Each
worker is providing the necessary labour for production. Unlike common usage,
labour refers to all human effort in production, not just manual labour. Hence, for
example, whether one is an engineer, manager, accountant, supervisor, machine
operator, sales representative or causal labour - all of them provide labour for a
factory to produce and sell its product.

The third requirement is capital, i.e. the variety of inputs required at every
stage during production. What are the items that come under capital?
(a) Tools, machines, buildings: Tools and machines range from very simple
tools such as a farmer's plough to sophisticated machines such as generators,
turbines, computer automated machines etc. They are not used up or consumed
immediately in the production process. They help to produce these goods over
many years. They require some repair and maintenance so that they remain useful
and can be used year after year. These are called fixed capital or physical capital.
However, all machines have to be replaced due to many years of use by new and
often better tools and machines.
(b) Raw materials and money required: The various raw materials such as
the yarn used by the weaver and the clay used by the potter are used in production.
Some money is also required to buy other necessary materials for production and
make payments for completing the production. It takes time to complete the
production and then sell these goods or services in the market. Only then does
money flow back into the production process. This requirement for raw material
and money is therefore called working capital. This is different from physical
capital because unlike tools, machines or buildings, these are used up in the
production cycle.
The fourth requirement is technology and enterprise: To be able to use
land, labour and physical capital in a meaningful way to produce some goods or
services, knowledge of the process of production and confidence is essential.
Owners of the physical capital or managers hired by them provide this knowledge.
The owners also have to take the risks of the market i.e. whether the goods or
services produced would find sufficient buyers. In our society, most goods and
services are produced for sale in the market, hence the entrepreneurs who produce
for the market have to plan, organise and manage. These entrepreneurs could be

After land, labour is the next necessary factor for production. Farming requires
a great deal of hard work. Small farmers, along with their families, mostly cultivate
their own fields. Generally, they provide the labour required for farming themselves.
Medium and large farmers hire farm labourers to work on their fields.
Farm labourers come either from landless families or families cultivating small
plots of land. Unlike farmers working on their own fields, farm labourers do not
have a right over the crops grown on the land. Instead they are paid wages by the
farmer for whom they work. They have been employed
to do the work.
Wages can be in cash or in kind (crop). Sometimes
labourers get meals too. Wages vary widely from region
to region, from crop to crop, from one farm activity to
another (like sowing and harvesting). There is also a wide
variation in the duration of employment. A farm labourer
might be employed on a daily basis or on contract for
one particular farm activity like harvesting or for the whole
year.
Fig 8.2 Potato harvesting in the Himalayas
Shivaiah is a landless farm labourer who works on
daily wages in Rampur. This means that he must regularly look for work. Shivaiah’s
wages are less than what the Uttar Pradesh government has set as minimum
wages for labourers. There is heavy competition for work among the farm
labourers in Rampur, so people agree to work for lower wages. With large farmers
increasingly relying on machines like tractors, threshers, harvesters, the number
of days of work available to a worker is very low in rural areas. In the whole of last
year, Shivaiah got less than five months of work on the farm. During the periods
when no work is available, Shivaiah and many like him have applied to village
Panchayat for work under MGNREGA.

Capital: Arranging physical and working capital
You have read in earlier classes about how modern farming involves high yielding
variety of seeds, assured irrigation, fertiliser and pesticides. This, in turn, means
that the farmers require a sufficient amount of capital for production, and therefore
money. Let’s see how farmers arrange for physical capital and working capital
required in farming.
Most small farmers have to borrow money to arrange for the working capital.
They borrow from large farmers or the village moneylenders or the traders who
supply various inputs for cultivation. The rate of interest on such loans is very high.
They are put to a great distress to repay the loan.
Savita is a small farmer. She plans to cultivate wheat on her 1 ha. of land.
Besides seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, she needs cash to buy water and repair
her farm instruments. She estimates that the working capital itself would cost a
minimum of Rs. 6000. She doesn't have the money, so she decides to borrow
from Tejpal, a large farmer. Tejpal agrees to give the loan to Savita at 36% per
annum interest rate, which is a high rate for four months. Savita also has to

promise to work on his field as a farm labourer during the harvest season at Rs 100
per day. As you can tell, this wage is quite low. Savita knows that she will have to
work very hard to complete the harvesting on her own field and then work as a
farm labourer for Tejpal. The harvest time is a very busy time. As a mother of three
children, she has a lot of household responsibilities. Savita agrees to these tough
conditions as she knows that getting a loan is difficult for a small farmer.
In contrast to the small farmers, the medium and large farmers generally have
their own savings from farming. They are thus able to arrange for seeds, fertiliser,
pesticide, payments to labourers etc - the working capital needed for farming. How
do these farmers have their own savings? You shall find the answer in the next section.
All large farmers in this village have tractors. They use them for ploughing and
sowing their farms and hire out these tractors to other small farmers. Most of them
also have threshers and some own harvesters. All such farmers have many tube
wells to irrigate their farms. These tools and machines are all part of physical capital
for farming.

SC
ER
T,

AL

Let us suppose that the farmers have produced wheat on their lands using the
three factors of production. They retain a part of the wheat for the family's
consumption and sell the surplus. Small farmers like Savita and Gobind's sons have
little surplus wheat because their total production is small and from this, a substantial
share is kept for their own family needs. So, generally it is the medium and large
farmers who supply wheat to the wholesale market yard. The traders at the market
yard buy the wheat and sell it further to shopkeepers in the towns and cities.
Tejpal, the large farmer, has a surplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all his
lands. He sells the surplus
wheat at the Raiganj market
yard and has good earnings.
What does Tejpal do with
his earnings? Last year, Tejpal
had put most of the money in
his bank account. Later, he
used the savings for lending to
farmers like Savita who were in
need of a loan. He also used the
Fig 8.3 : Grain being taken to the market
savings to arrange for the
working capital for farming in
the next season. This year Tejpal plans to use his earnings to buy another tractor.
There is good business in hiring out tractors in the neighbouring villages. Another
tractor would increase his fixed capital.
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22 111

A

Like Tejpal, other large and medium farmers sell the surplus farm produce. A
part of the earnings is saved and kept for buying capital for the next season. Some
farmers might also use the savings to buy cattle, trucks or to set up shops. These
constitute the capital for non-farm activities. They may also buy more land.
There is often a loss in farm activities, espeically when crops are damaged
because of floods, pests etc. The other risk is sudden fall in the price of agricultural
produce. In such situations, farmers find it difficult to recover the working capital
that they had spent.
Surplus and Capital for Production

Consider three farmers. Each has grown wheat on his field though the production
is different as in Column 2. To analyse the situation faced by different farmers,
we need to assume that some conditions are the same for all. To keep things simple,
let us suppose the following conditions:

AN

1. The consumption of wheat by each farmer family is the same (Column 3).
2. The whole of surplus wheat this year is used as seeds for working capital for the
next year’s production by all the farmers. They also have land to do so.

AL

3. Also suppose, production output is twice the working capital used in production in
all the farms. There is no sudden loss in production.

NON-FARM ACTIVITIES IN RAMPUR

engaged in activities other than agriculture.

Dairy - The other common activity

Dairy production is a common activity in many families of Rampur. People
feed their buffaloes on various kinds of grass and jowar and bajra fodder cultivated
during the rainy season. The milk is sold in Raiganj. Two traders from Jahangirabad
have set up collection cum chilling centers at Raiganj from where the milk is
transported to faraway places such as Bulandshahr and Delhi. The production factors
of this activity are briefly described:
Land: Own shed in the village
Labour: Family labour, especially women to look after the buffaloes
Physical Capital: Buffaloes purchased at the cattle fair
Working capital: Feed from their land, some medicines are purchased

Small-scale manufacturing activities in Rampur
At present, less than fifty people are engaged in manufacturing activities in
Rampur. Unlike manufacturing which that takes place in big factories in the towns
and cities, manufacturing in Rampur involves very simple production methods and
is done on a small scale. Manufacturing is carried out mostly at home or in the
fields with the help of family labour. Labourers are rarely hired.
Mishrilal has purchased a mechanical sugarcane crushing machine run on
electricity and prepares jaggery. Earlier, sugarcane was crushed by using bullocks,
but these days people prefer to do it with machines. Apart from using the

A few shopkeepers also buy goods that the villagers produce and supply it to
shops/ markets in the bigger villages and towns. For instance, the person running
the flour mill also buys wheat from the small farmers in the village and sells it at
the Raiganj market. Flour milling and trading are two different businesses.

Transport: A fast developing sector

A variety of vehicles on the road connect Rampur to Raiganj. Rickshawallahs,
tongawallahs, jeep- tractor- truck- drivers and people driving the traditional
bullock cart and bogey are in the transport services. They ferry people and goods
from one place to another and get paid for it in return. The number of people
involved in transport has grown over the last several years.

Summing up

SC
ER
T,

TE

AL

Farming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there
have been many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have
allowed the farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is
an important achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production
a great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources. There is
urgent need to review the methods of production and ensure sustainable use of the
resources.
Farming now needs much more of capital. The medium and large farmers are
able to use their own savings from production to arrange for capital during the next
season. On the other hand, the small farmers who constitute about 87 percent of
total farmers in India find it difficult to obtain capital. Because of the small size of
their plots, their production is not enough. The lack of surplus means that they are
unable to obtain capital from their own savings, and have to borrow. Besides the
debt, many of the small farmers have to do additional work as farm labourers because
of the low income.
Labour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if the
new ways of farming used much more labour. Unfortunately, such a thing has not
happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour, looking for
opportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some
labour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.
At present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Though there is
a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only seen a few examples),
the number of people employed in each is quite small. In 2009-2010, out of every
100 workers in the rural areas in India, 32 are engaged in non-farm activities. This

includes the workers who are employed as part of MGNREGA on various projects.
MGNREGA has provided some support to the incomes of rural workers.
In the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the
village. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some
amount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?
One can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is important
that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without savings can
start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for expansion of
non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services produced can
be sold. In Rampur, we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and cities provide the
markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get connected to towns and
cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is possible that the
opportunities for non-farm production activities in the village would increase in
the coming years.

Production across Countries

Until the middle of the twentieth century, production was largely organised
within countries. Raw materials, food grains and finished products only crossed
the boundaries of these countries. Colonies such as India exported raw materials
and food grains and imported finished goods. Trade was the main channel that
connected distant countries. This was before the large multinational companies
(MNCs) emerged on the scene. An MNC is a company that owns or controls
production in more than one nation. MNCs set up offices and factories for
production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources. This is
done so that the cost of production is low and the MNCs can earn greater profits.
Consider the following example. A large MNC, producing industrial equipment,
designs its products in research centres in the United States and then has the
components manufactured in China. These are then shipped to Mexico and Eastern
Europe where the products are assembled and the finished products are sold all
over the world. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out through
call centres located in India. (Identify these countries on a world map.)

In this example, the MNC is not only selling its finished products globally, but
more important, the goods and services are also being produced globally. As a result,
production is organised in increasingly complex ways. The production process is
divided into small parts and spread out across the globe. In the above example,
China provides the advantage of being a cheap manufacturing location. Mexico and
Eastern Europe are useful for their closeness to the markets in the US and Europe.
India has educated English speaking youth who can provide customer care services.
And all this probably can mean 50-60 per cent cost-savings for the MNC! The
advantage of spreading out production across the borders to the multinationals can
be truly immense.

In general, the criteria for selecting a site for operations of MNCs are: proximity
to the markets; availability of skilled and unskilled labour at low costs; assured
availability of other factors of production, government policies that protect their
interests. The money that MNCs spend to buy assets such as land, building, machines
and other equipment is called foreign investment. Any investment is made with the
hope that these assets will earn profits.
At times, MNCs set up production jointly with the local companies in these
countries. The local company benefits by the additional investments and the latest
technology that the MNCs bring.
But the most common route for MNC investments is to buy these local
companies and then to expand production. MNCs with huge amounts of wealth can
quite easily do so. For example, Cargill Foods, a large American MNC, has bought
over smaller Indian companies such as Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had four edible
oil refineries and a large marketing network in various parts of India, where its
brand was well-reputed. With the takeovers, Cargill is now the largest producer of
edible oil in India.
In fact, many of the top MNCs have wealth exceeding the entire budgets of the
governments of developing country. With such enormous amount of wealth, imagine
the power and influence of these MNCs!
There’s another way in which MNCs control production. Large MNCs in
developed countries place orders for production with small producers. Garments,
footwear, sports items are examples of industries where production is carried out
by a large number of small producers around the world. The products are supplied
to the MNCs, which then sell them under their own brand name to the customers.
These large MNCs have tremendous power to determine the price, quality, delivery
and labour conditions for these distant producers. Because of the MNCs, production
in widely dispersed locations is getting interlinked.

To put it simply, foreign trade creates an opportunity for the producers to
reach beyond the domestic markets. Similarly, for the buyers, trade expands the
choice of goods beyond what is domestically produced. Foreign trade, thus, results
in connecting the markets or integration of markets in different countries.

In the past three or four decades, more and more MNCs have been looking for
locations around the world which would make production cheaper for them. Foreign
investment by MNCs in these countries has been rising. At the same time, foreign
trade between countries has been rising rapidly. A large part of foreign trade is also
controlled by MNCs. For instance, the car manufacturing plant of Ford Motors in
India not only produces cars for the Indian markets, it also exports cars to other
developing countries and exports car components for its many factories around
the world. Likewise, activities of most MNCs involve substantial trade in goods
and services.

Chinese manufacturers started exporting plastic toys to India. Buyers in India now
have the option of choosing between Indian and the Chinese toys. Because of the
cheaper prices and new designs, Chinese toys became popular in the Indian markets.
Within a year, 70 to 80 per cent of the toy shops have replaced Indian toys with Chinese
toys. Toys are now cheaper in the Indian markets than earlier.
For the Chinese toy makers, this trade provided an opportunity to expand their

The result of greater foreign investment and greater foreign trade has been
greater integration of production and markets across countries. Globalisation is a
process of rapid integration or interconnection between countries. MNCs are
playing a major role in the globalisation process. More and more goods and services,
investments and technology are moving between countries. Most regions of the world
are now in closer contact with each other as compared to a few decades back.
The flow of capital, people and technology is supposed to have created a
borderless world. As a result, states lose power to determine many aspects of life
even within their borders. For instance, the most important decisions regarding the
value of a currency, which were earlier made by sovereign governments, are today
made outside government corridors and more often by market players and forces
over which governments have very little control.

Let us return to the example of import of Chinese toys in India. Suppose, the
Indian government imposes a tax on import of toys. And because of the tax, buyers
will have to pay a higher price on imported toys. Chinese toys will no longer be as
cheap in the Indian markets, imports from China will automatically reduce and Indian
toy-makers will prosper.
Tax on imports is an example of trade barrier. It is called a barrier because
some restriction has been set up. Governments can use trade barriers to increase
or decrease (regulate) foreign trade and to decide what kinds of goods and how
much of each, should come into the country.
The Indian government, after Independence, had put barriers to foreign trade
and foreign investment. This was considered necessary to protect the producers
within the country from foreign competition. Industries were just coming up in the
1950s and 1960s and competition from imports at that stage would not have allowed
these industries to survive. Thus, India allowed import of only essential items such

as machinery, fertilisers, petroleum etc. Note that all the developed countries, during
the early stages of development, have given protection to domestic producers
through a variety of means.
However, around 1991, some far reaching changes in policy were made in India.
The government identify that the time had come for Indian producers to compete
with producers around the globe. It felt that competition would improve the
performance of producers within the country since they would have to improve
their quality. This decision was supported by powerful international organisations.
Thus, barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment were removed to a large
extent. This meant that goods could be imported and exported easily and foreign
companies could also set up factories and offices here.

SC
ER
T,

Removing barriers or restrictions set by the government is known as
liberalisation. With liberalisation of trade, businesses are allowed to make decisions
freely about what they wish to import or export. The government imposes less
restrictions than earlier and is therefore said to be more liberal.
We must now ask ourselves what actually drives globalisation. Is it a political
decision or is it an economic and technological revolution? Economic proponents
of globalisation argue that it is the economic forces that are responsible for
globalisation and control its contours and borders. Those holding the political line
argue that it is the government decisions that allow movement in the first place.
Governments place restrictions or ease regulations. The attractiveness or
unattractiveness of places has to do with the political climate and not necessarily
the market conditions. Therefore the territory still matters. In reality, both are
connected. We must remember that political decisions are taken in a particular
context which accounts for the economic and technological change that has already
taken place.

We read earlier that the liberalisation of foreign trade and investment in India
was supported by some very powerful international organisations. These
organisations believe that barriers to foreign trade and investment are harmful.
Trade between countries should be ‘free’ without any barriers. World Trade
Organisation (WTO) is one such organisation whose aim is to liberalise international
trade. Started at the initiative of the developed countries, WTO establishes rules
regarding international trade, and sees that these rules are obeyed. Nearly 150
countries of the world are currently members of the WTO.
Though WTO is supposed to allow free trade for all, in practice it is often seen
that the developed countries have unfairly retained trade barriers. On the other
hand, WTO rules have forced the developing countries to remove trade barriers. An
example of this is the current debate on trade in agricultural products.

Impact of Globalisation in India

What has been the effect of globalisation on the lives of people? Globalisation
has been of advantage to consumers, particularly the well-off sections in the urban
areas. There is greater choice before these consumers who now enjoy improved
quality and lower price products. As a result, these people today enjoy much higher
standards of living than was possible earlier. Among producers and workers, the
impact of globalisation has not been uniform.
Firstly, MNCs have increased their investments in India, which means investing
in India has been beneficial for them. MNCs have been interested in industries
such as cell phones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food or services
such as banking in urban areas. These products have a large number of well-off
buyers. In these industries and services, new jobs have been created. Local
companies supplying raw materials etc. to these industries have also prospered.

The agriculture sector provides the bulk of
employment in India. Compare this with a
developed country such as the US with the
share of agriculture in GDP at 1% and its
share in total employment a tiny 0.5%! And
yet this very small percentage of people who
are engaged in agriculture in the US receive
massive sums of money from the US
government for production and for exports
to other countries. Due to this large amount
of money that they receive, US farmers can
sell the farm products at abnormally low
prices. The surplus farm products are sold
in the markets in other country at low prices,
adversely affecting farmers in these
countries.
Developing countries are, therefore, asking
the governments of developed country, “We
have reduced trade barriers as per WTO
rules. But you have ignored the rules of WTO
and have continued to pay your farmers vast
sums of money. You have asked our
governments to stop supporting our
farmers, but you are doing so yourselves. Is
this free and fair trade?”

In the example on the left, we saw
that the US government gives massive
sums of money to farmers for
production. At times, governments
also give support to promote
production of certain types of goods,
such as those which are
environmentally friendly. Discuss

Moreover, globalisation has enabled some large Indian companies to emerge
as multinationals themselves! Tata Motors (automobiles), Infosys (IT), Ranbaxy

Indian companies which are spreading their operations worldwide.
Globalisation has also created new opportunities for companies providing
services, particularly those involving IT. The Indian company producing a magazine
for the London based company and call centres are some examples. Besides, a
host of services such as data entry, accounting, administrative tasks, engineering
are now being done at cheaper costs in countries such as India and are exported to

The above evidence indicates that not everyone has benefited from globalisation.

benefits. Since globalisation is now a reality, the question is how to make
globalisation more ‘fair’? Fair globalisation would create opportunities for all,
and ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better.
The government can play a major role in making this possible. Its policies
must protect the interests not only of the rich and the powerful, but also the interests
of all the people in the country. You have read about some of the possible steps that
the government can take to ensure this. For instance, the government can ensure

that labour laws are properly implemented and the workers get their rights. It can
support small producers to improve their performance till the time they become
strong enough to compete. If necessary, the government can use trade and investment
barriers. It can negotiate at the WTO for ‘fairer rules’. It can also align with other
developing countries with similar interests to fight against the domination of
developed countries in the WTO.
In the past few years, massive campaigns and representations by people’s
organisations have influenced important decisions relating to trade and investments
at the WTO. This has demonstrated that people also can play an important role in
the struggle for fair globalisation.

An important question that has often been debated is whether globalisation has
seen the demise of nation state or not. For most part of the time, the nation state
with people organised on territorial grounds was the main form of political
organisation when it came to demarcating countries. This territorial division created
divisions of us and them, of outside and inside and laid the psychological foundations
for creating a feeling for one’s own country, the feeling of nationalism. The single
most important impact of globalisation is the gradual dilution of this feeling.
Another issue that received attention is about whether globalisation leads to
cultural homogenisation or increases cultural diversity? While some argue that
the impact of modern communication and technology has led to the spread of only
a few certain cultures and ideas which have marginalised local and small cultures,
others argue that globalisation has also given space to and allowed the spread of
distinctive and often marginalised cultural practices. It has been pointed out that

multinational corporations with huge wealth and power is one hallmark of the present
phase of globalisation. Liberalisation, by removing barriers to trade and investment,
has opened the economies to the forces of globalisation.
The benefits of globalisation have been unevenly distributed. It has benefited
well-off consumers and as well as producers with skill, education and huge amount
of wealth. Certain services that are enabled with technology have expanded. On
the other hand, thousands of small producers and workers have seen their
employment and workers’ rights erode. It is important to understand the two-sided
nature of globalisation.
The other dimension of inequality, which we saw is in the dominating influence
of the rich countries on matters of policy. Be it policies on international economic
exchange – trade, investment, migration - or domestic matters, rich western
countries have an undue influence over the rest of the world. International
organisations like WTO, WB and the IMF represent the interests of the developed
countries far more than that of the developing world. Thus, while the supporters of
globalisation speak of the advantages of global integration and see globalisation as
an opportunity for growth and prosperity, its critics point out that it is another
attempt by some countries - read the west - to dominate the world. They argue that
it harms democracy, workers rights, and the environment in many of the poorer
countries.

cultivation has been roughly unchanged
since the last few decades. Yield then
becomes a crucial variable. Look at Graph 2.
In order to increase the per hectare yield of a crop, necessary inputs have to be
provided in a judicious manner. One way is to expand irrigation but use water in a
manner that this vital resource is shared and made available to all.

Availability of Foodgrains

The first requirement for a country is to able to produce foodgrains for the
whole of its population. How do we measure whether there is enough food for all
or not? Whether this food reaches families or not would be examined later. We are
at first estimating what is available. This means that per person (or per capita)
availability of foodgrains in the country should be sufficient and also increasing
over the years. Is the increase in foodgrain availability really happening?

There is a difference between production and availability of foodgrains. This is
estimated as:
Availability of foodgrains for the year = Production of foodgrains during
the year (production – seed, feed and wastage) + net imports (imports – exports) change in stocks with the government (closing stock at the year end- opening stock
at the beginning)
Availability of foodgrains per person per day = (Availability of foodgrains
for the year ÷ population)/ 365
Information relating to production, imports and change in government stocks
are given in the following table for three years – 1971, 1991 and 2011. Besides
production, imports are a way of increasing the availability of foodgrains in any
particular year. Another important source of foodgrain availability is the change in
government stocks. The government can, for instance, increase the availability of
rice for the people by selling rice from its existing stocks. While the stocks of rice
with the government reduces, the amount of rice available for consumption in that
year increases. (You will read more about government stocks in the next section.)
As shown for 1971, calculate per person availability of foodgrains for 1991
and 2011.

Many believe ‘coarse’ cereals to be inferior grains. Because these are called
coarse grains, we think these are rough and unhealthy. On the contrary, these are
highly nutritious and wholesome grains. They are a staple diet of millions of people
living in the dry land regions of the country. Once very common in Indian households,
the label ‘coarse’ cereals came with colonial rulers who preferred the white colour
of rice and wheat and looked down upon local food and cultural practices. Today,
many prefer to call these cereals “nutri-cereals”.

Availability of Other Food Items

SC
ER
T,

TE

It is said that there is a change in consumption pattern with people demanding
more fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, poultry and fisheries. This is a good sign for
the consumers as well as producers. Consumers need a diverse food basket and a
balanced diet. Farmers producing foodgrains can go for crop diversification in order
to increase their incomes. You may recall from what we read in the earlier classes
about the conversion of foodgrain fields into cash crops such as cotton in Telangana
during the last two decades. This was one of the reasons for farmer’s distress and
even suicides. Farmers can instead pay attention to allied activities such as poultry,
fishing and dairying since they provide new opportunities for farmers.
Although there has been increase in production of other food items over the
years, it is not sufficient to meet the minimum dietary requirements. Nutritionists
suggest that every person in India should eat 300 grams of vegetables and 100 grams
of fruits in a day whereas per person availability of these food materials is 180 and
58 grams respectively. Similarly per person requirement of eggs is 180 whereas
the availability of eggs is 30. The meat dietary requirements are 11 kilograms per
year whereas the per person availability is only 3.2 kilograms. We require 300
millilitres of milk whereas the per person availability is 210 millilitres a day.
Farmers thus require support in terms of inputs and market opportunities for
diversification to other food items. Farmers may have to be supported and guarded
against market risks that they face in the new situation.

of food simultaneously.

Access to Food

The next important aspect of food security is the access to food. It is not
sufficient to produce foodgrains and other items. Everyone should be able to buy
them for consumption. Is everyone able to access the minimum food requirement?
You may recall what you studied in Class VIII about poverty. Food we eat gets
burnt in our body and produces heat and this is measured in terms of calories. This
helps to do our work. If we eat less or less nutritious food, the calorie intake of our
body becomes less and hence we may find it difficult to work or our health may get

beyond the recommended calorie
requirements, for a large proportion of the population, the food intake is inadequate
to provide the calories required. 80 percent of people in rural areas in India consume
food that is below the calorie standard. In the Graph 3, you can see the lowest
calorie intake is for the people who are the poorest in the rural areas. And it is way
below the recommended standard of 2400! Whereas these are the people who are
involved in the most difficult and heavy manual labour.
The major reason for low calorie intake is the lack of purchasing power of the
people. People don’t have adequate incomes to buy food. There are various reasons
for this as you have read in the discussions on poverty, unemployment, public
facilities, etc. Can you recall some of these before you proceed?

Public Distribution System (PDS)
Ration shops are important means for people to access foodgrains in India.

families have been identified and foodgrains are sold to at different prices to poor
and non-poor. Even among the poor, the very poor have different entitlements, or

PDS and Buffer Stock
The stock of foodgrains mainly wheat and rice procured and maintained by the
government through Food Corporation of India (FCI) is called buffer stock. The FCI
purchases wheat and rice from the farmers in states where there is surplus production.
The farmers are paid a pre-announced price for their crops. This price is called Minimum
Support Price (MSP). The MSP is declared by a government agency every year.
The state and Central Governments procure nearly one-third of foodgrains from
farmers. These foodgrains are distributed to people through various mechanisms. In
recent times, the government agencies are procuring more foodgrains than what is
required to meet the public distribution system. If government stocks keep increasing
year after year, less is available (see year 2011 in Table on foodgrain availability). The
government has been often criticised that it does not properly distribute these
foodgrains to the needy people. Sometimes, governments also exports these foodgrains
to other countries. Do you think it is good idea to export foodgrains and earn a small
income when a large section of people within the country are not able to access
foodgrains?
The Indian government came out with a new law in 2013 called the National
Food Security Act to legalise peoples’ Right to Food. It applies to approximately 2/
3rd of the population of India. As per this law, every person of low income families
is entitled to 5 kilograms of foodgrains per month at subsidised rates. Among poor
Free distribution by T.S. Government 2021-22 139

families, the poorest ones are entitled to 35 kilograms of foodgrains. For a few
years, the central government will supply rice, wheat and millets for Rs.3, Rs.2 and
Rs.1 respectively. Under this law, if required, a maximum of 75% of people living
in rural areas and 50 per cent of urban population have the right to buy foodgrains
from public distribution system. If the government is not able to arrange foodgrains,
it will give cash to the people to buy foodgrains. This law also envisages providing
free cooked meals for pregnant women, lactating mothers, children aged 1-6 coming
to anganwadis and mid-day meals for children aged 6-14 in schools.

While Indian Parliament enacts various laws such as National Food Security
Act and implements schemes such as Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS),
in recent times, the Indian judiciary also has become pro-active in ensuring food
security. Through judicial verdict on court cases filed by non-governmental
organisations, the Supreme Court directed all the state governments and central
government to provide mid-day meals to all the young children studying in schools.
Though such schemes existed on a small scale in a few states like Tamil Nadu, this
scheme is now being implemented in all the states. About 14 crore children studying
in schools eat mid-day meal today. When state governments refused to implement
this scheme, the court also set up monitoring mechanisms and provided suggestions
for better implementation such as school mid-day meals should be locally produced,
hot and cooked (and not dry snacks or grain which many governments distributed
until then), hygienic, nutritious (of a prescribed minimum caloric level) and with
varied menus for every day of the week. The court also ruled that preference be
given to dalit cooks, widows and destitute women. This is the largest school feeding
programme in the world. In order to generate revenue for this scheme, the court
directed the Indian government to impose taxes. The hot cooked meal is also now
provided in anganwadis for children.

Nutrition status

Lastly, we look at the nutrition status of children and adults to judge whether
the food actually consumed is adequate. This also informs us if the above discussed
systems are working effectively or not and what are the problem areas.
Food is required by the body for all its functions - for energy, growth and the
capacity to remain healthy and fight illness. The food that we consume is normally
classified as:
Carbohydrates: that provide energy, through wheat, rice, ragi, jowar, oils, sugar,
fats etc.
Proteins: that help growth and regeneration of body tissues, through beans,
dals, meat, eggs, rice, wheat etc.
Vitamins: that provide protection and ensure the working of many vital systems of
the body through foods such as fruits, leafy vegetables, sprouts, unpolished rice etc.
Minerals : That are required in small quantities for many important functions
such as iron for blood formation. This is provided through green leafy vegetables,
ragi etc.

If we conduct a survey, as you have done in some previous chapters, we can find
out about the food people eat by asking them to describe their meals for the day.
Through this, we can get a rough idea of whether all the food groups above are being
covered. However, it is difficult to measure the precise amounts of carbohydrates,
vitamins, proteins, minerals being consumed by each individual in the family.
Nutritionists have devised indicators using height and weight that can inform us whether
individuals are well nourished. Through various measurements of large population
and using statistical knowledge nutritionists have been able to arrive at reliable standard
ranges. A comparison for individual persons is therefore possible. This gives us the
most reliable source of information about nutritional status of people.
A survey conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad (NIN)
across many states in the country confirms the overall alarming status of nutrition
in the country. While we have looked at case studies that depict real family situations
of under nutrition and poverty in previous classes, it is also important to examine
some of these faceless statistics. They help us to examine whether these situations
are exceptions or an indication of a general trend. They also help us to look at
issues that may be hidden and not so obvious to common sense.
As discussed above, to examine the nutritional status of children, simple but
accurate measurements of height and weight are used. You could visit an anganwadi
center and observe how this is carried out. Since children grow fast, their weight
changes significantly with age, unlike in adults. For this indicator to be reliable,
weight is to be accurately measured and the correct age should be mentioned. These

readings are then plotted against charts that have been developed by nutritionists to
examine if they fall with in a normal range or below.
For example, when we plot the weight of a child against his age it tells us whether
the child is underweight. This is for one child.
What does the NIN survey indicate? Out of the seven thousand children, in the
age group 1-5 years examined in the survey from many states in the country, 45%
of children are underweight. Their weight was less than what is expected by normal
standards. These children are in fact hunger stricken and not getting adequate food.
Unless they are severely underweight, it may not be easily visible or identifiable.
Going just by common sense, we fail to realise that enormous number of children
in the country are underweight. We are so used to seeing such children that we take
this as “normal”. The survey jolts our common sense and makes us realise that this
situation would seriously affect the growth and capacities of nearly half of the total
number of children in the country.
The report says:
“The overall prevalence of underweight was about 45% and it was significantly
higher among 3-5 year, compared to 1-3 year children. The prevalence was more
than 50% in the States of Gujarat (58%), Madhya Pradesh (56.9%) and Uttar
Pradesh (53.2%) and observed lowest in Kerala (24%). …
“The overall prevalence of severe underweight was about 16%. …”

This index is compared with a range to show if the individual is underweight,
within normal range or overweight. A high value shows excess fat and a low value
show a fat level that is less than what is required. According to NIN report, the
situation for adult men and women are as follows:
“The prevalence of chronic energy deficiency ( BMI<18.5) among men was
about 35% , while overweight/obesity (BMI >25) was 10%. ………
“About 35% of adult women had chronic energy deficiency and14% were
overweight/ obese. The prevalence of chronic energy deficiency was highest in
the States of Odisha,Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, followed by 33-38% in Karnataka,
Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal ....”
How is this related to food security?
A doctor who is working in a rural area of
Chhattisgarh running a community health
programme where streams of underweight
patients come every day explains this link.
From a study of the patients, he found that
the PDS grain of 35kg/ per month for a
family of five lasted only 11 days. For the
rest of the month, they have to depend on
the market or their own produce.
For example, a rickshaw puller in
Bilaspur who earns 70-80 rupees a day
would try to survive on the PDS grain,
Fig 10.2 : Ration Shop
spending Rs 400 on rent and Rs 100 on
electricity. It was not surprising that he lost weight and caught tuberculosis.
These measures are thus indicators of food security. The doctor from Chattisgarh
says :
No one would have a lower weight or height if he/ she had access to adequate
food. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We can judge all processes like
efficacy of the PDS, the importance given to growing food crops, and the
purchasing power of people by looking at body parameters like weight and height.
Besides, a person’s height can also tell us whether food was available during his/
her childhood. We can still choose to describe underweight and stunted people
as malnourished if we like. But I suggest the correct term would be ‘hunger’ “.

Summing up

The first section examined the issue of food security from the point of view of
overall production of food in the country. What can be done to increase the food
production remains an important question. Next, we discussed how availability is
measured. A worrying fact is that per person availability of foodgrains has actually
not risen but declined in the recent years.

Whatever is produced and is available has to reach the people. This could be
through what they purchase in the market or in the ration shop or through schemes
such as mid day meals etc. Here, we found that most people are in fact consuming
fewer calories than required. This gap is severe for the poorest. Though there’s a
shift towards other foods such as fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs and this is welcome,
deficiency in calorie intake is alarming. PDS is not effective in places where they
are most needed. This serious situation is revealed through nutrition surveys that
show children and adults as being underweight in a chronic way. Over a long period
of time, 35% to 45% of people are consuming less food than they should. A large
section of people are malnourished (or hungry), even when we have adequate food
in the country. This is not acceptable.The issue of food security needs careful
thinking and effort in all the above directions.

As a measure of development, Human Development Index (HDI) is an
improvement over GDP and per capita income (refer to Chapter 2). Whereas GDP
is an indicator of the value of goods and services produced in the country, the idea
of progress can hardly be limited to production of goods and services. This is
more so when rapid expansion of production and incomes can coexist with
malnutrition and lack of education and health for a large proportion of the people,
as is the case in India. HDI expands the meaning of development to include social
indicators of education and health.

There are, however, many other considerations that even this expanded measure
of development does not capture. In India, more than 90% of the workforce is in
the unorganised sector, where the conditions of work are not encouraging at all.
Incomes of both self-employed and wage workers in the unorganised sector are
generally low, at times pitiably so (refer to Chapter 3). With such a high percentage
of workforce in low-paid employment, increase in GDP and the enormous variety
of goods and services being produced can benefit only select groups. People with
high income and wealth are the ones who have all the choices in the world to buy
and consume (refer to Chapter

Another major criticism of economic development focused narrowly on GDP
springs from its neglect of The Environment. In various contexts, we have seen
how the Environmental resources have been used up and damaged to an
unprecedented extent in the course of economic growth. Deforestation, soil erosion,
lowering groundwater tables, increasing pollution, pressure on grazing land, rising
dependence on fossil fuels, industrial emissions, use of chemical fertilisers and
pesticides in agriculture, climate change are some of the important and urgent
environmental issues before us. While industrialisation has brought a lot of material
comforts, at least to some, it has resulted in a world where natural resources are
threatened and now even the climate is being disrupted. This pattern of growth
clearly cannot continue.

In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between development, The
Environment and people. How has expansion of economic activities affected
different aspects of The Environment? What has development meant for peoples’
access and rights to natural resources and their lives? Can there be different models
of development? We will seek answers to these questions through live issues and
peoples’ lived experiences. We find that there is a need to broaden the focus of
development from material goods and services to all the people (present & future
generations) as well as The Environment with all its living and non-living resources.

used to clean products, discarded packaging and goods that are no longer wanted
are absorbed by The Environment. This is as important as the source function. The
"sink function" describes an The Environment's ability to absorb and render harmless
waste and pollution. When waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function,
long-term damage to The Environment occurs.
In the past fifty years of economic development, both these functions of The
Environment have been overused. This has been said to affect the carrying capacity
of The Environment, i.e. the capacity of The Environment to support economic
production and consumption in the future. Let’s look at few examples.
Example 1: As per the
traditional practices, the lifting of
water was limited to supplemental
irrigation or for a small area. For
example, with ‘mota baavi’ only 2
to 3 acres can be irrigated.
Agriculture was limited to rainy
season and large areas were
rainfed drylands. Over time, with
new energy resources, pumpsets
that work with petrol/ diesel and
electricity came into picture. The
impact has to be seen in two
phases: initially there was relief
Fig 11.3 : A UN photo from 1957 Farming and
from drudgery; lifting of water
irrigation in Rajastan
became very easy with pumps.
Water was also available in plenty. Open wells had water at 10 to 15 feet deep;
utmost 100 feet depth. However, with the lifting of groundwater by electric and
motor pumps, water table started going down. So much so, that in some areas,
groundwater is being drawn from a few hundred feet deep. When it rain sum of
the rain water, seeps in to the ground. This is called ‘recharge’. The path of water
under the ground is through the medium of soil and rocks. If the water drawn
out is more than what is being recharged then it is obvious that after sometime,
groundwater level will fall.
Recent data on the status of groundwater resources in India suggests that
the groundwater is under serious threat of overuse in many parts of the country.
Nearly one-third of the country is pumping out more groundwater than what
goes in as recharge. About 300 districts have reported a water level decline of

and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and south India, some coastal
areas and the rapidly growing urban settlements.
Overuse of groundwater implies that the stock of groundwater is depleting. the
groundwater has been falling to lower and lower levels very rapidly.
The quality of groundwater is deteriorating along with the quantity. In 59% of
districts of India, water from hand pumps and wells is unsafe for drinking. This is
because of contamination of groundwater from chemical industrial waste from
agriculture and industry. Water is being used as a sink to dump all kinds of waste
and toxic substances. This is not easily reversible. We will see the consequences
of this in the next example.
This pattern of development is in direct contrast to what sustainable
development stands for. Sustainable development is development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs. In other words, a better quality of life for everyone - now
and for generations to come.
However, the extent of our current resource use is such that the chances of
future generations to have access to their fair share of scarce resources are
endangered. Moreover, the consequences of our resource use in terms of impact
on The Environment may induce serious damages that go beyond the carrying
capacity of The Environment.
Example 2: Pesticides are an important component of the modern agricultural
practice and are used to protect the crops from pests so that the
yield is high. The Environmentalists, however, realized a long time
ago that the use of pesticides has adverse impact on The
Environment. The Environment is simply unable to absorb the
toxic substances beyond a point.
In the year 1962, Rachel Carson wrote in the book ‘Silent
Spring’ about the impact of spraying DDT for mosquito control
on birds and human beings. Substances like heavy metals
contained in pesticides do not decompose from The Environment
but instead accumulate inside living organisms. Thus, the poison
in DDT gets deposited in the body of the fishes in the lakes where the water
containing DDT flows. The poison is too small in quantity to kill the fishes. But if
one bird eats several fishes, the combined dose of the chemical inside the fishes
is lethal enough for the bird. Rachel Carson also showed that insects like
mosquitoes quickly develop resistance to DDT sprays. Her findings are a clear
example of how human action irreversibly destroys nature and human beings
themselves.
In India, the lethal impact of pesticides was seen for pesticide Endosulfan. In
1976, to protect the cashew crop from pests, the government carried out

Today, there are countless cases where attempts at modern development have
caused large scale the Environmental problems. The case of big dams is a classic
case and one that has very painful consequences.
The Narmada Valley Development Project is the single largest river development
scheme in India. It is one of the largest hydroelectric projects in the world and is
supposed to generate power, provide irrigation and help with flood control.
The Environmental costs of such a project, which involves the construction of more
than 3,000 large and small dams, are immense. The largest of the dams constructed
is the Sardar Sarovar, which floods more than 37,000 hectares of forest and
agricultural land, displacing more than half a million people and destroying some
of India’s most fertile land. The project has devastated human lives and biodiversity
by inundating thousands of acres of forests and agricultural land. A disproportionate
number of those being displaced are Adivasis and Dalits.
The following letter was written by Baba Mahariya of Jalsindhi village in Jhabua
district to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in 1994. It was recorded in bhilala
and translated into Hindi and a part of it is reproduced below. It questions the very
idea of development.

We are people of the river bank; we live on the banks of the great Narmada. This
year (1994), our village Jalsindhi will be the first village in Madhya Pradesh to be
submerged by the Sardar Sarovar dam. Along with us, four or five other villages - Sakarja,
Kakarsila, Akadia and others - will also be drowned.... When the water comes into our
village, when our homes and fields are flooded, we will also drown - this is our firm
resolve.
We are writing this letter to let you know why the adivasi (tribal) peasants of
Jalsindhi who are coming under submergence, are preparing to drown themselves.

You, and all those who live in cities, think that we who live in the hills are poor and
backward, like apes. “Go to the plains of Gujarat. Your condition will improve. You will
develop” - this is what you advise us. But we have been fighting for eight years - we
have borne lathi blows, been to jail several times, in Anjanvara village the police even
came and fired on us and destroyed our homes.... If it is true that our situation will
improve in Gujarat, then why aren't all of us even now ready to go there?

SC

To you officials and people of the town, our land looks hilly and inhospitable, but
we are very satisfied with living in this area on the bank of the Narmada with our lands
and forests. We have lived here for generations. On this land our ancestors cleared the
forest, worshipped gods, improved the soil, domesticated animals and settled villages.
It is that very land that we till. You think we are poor. We are not poor. We have
constructed our own houses where we live. We are farmers. Our agriculture prospers
here. We earn by tilling the earth. Even with only the rains, we live by what we grow.
Mother corn feeds us. We have some tilled land in the village and some in the forest
area. On that we grow bajra, jowar, maize, boadi, bate, saunvi, kadri, chana, moth,
urdi, sesame and groundnut. We have many different kinds of crops. We keep varying
them and eating.
What grows in Gujarat? Wheat, jowar,
tuvar, red gram and some cotton. Less to
eat, more to sell. We cultivate in order to
eat; we sell only the excess for buying
clothes etc. Whether the price in the
market be high or low, we get food to eat.
We grow so many different kinds of
food, but all from our own effort. We have

much money? Who will know us there? Which moneylender will give us money? If we
don't get a good crop and don't have any money, then we will have to mortgage our
land.

A

Here we bring water to our fields by making channels from streams .... If we had
electricity, then we could also pump up water from the Narmada and get a winter
crop. But even though forty-fifty years have passed since independence, there is no
electricity in the villages along the river, nor is there river irrigation.

.... We have flowing water and good fodder in the forest. We don't live as much by
farming as we do by our livestock. We keep hens, goats, cows and buffaloes. Some
have 2-4 buffaloes, some have 8-10. Almost everyone has ten -twenty-forty goats....
From Gujarat people come to our hills to graze their cattle. Our fodder and water is so

We build our houses from its wood - from teak and bamboo. From ningodi and hiyali
(types of bamboo) splints we weave screens. From the forests we make baskets and
cots, ploughs and hoes.... We also eat leaves from the forest, hegva, mahia, amli,
goindi, bhanjan - all these leaves we eat. If there is a famine we survive by eating
roots and tubers. When we fall sick, our medicine men bring us back to health by
giving us leaves, roots, bark from the forest.... We know the name of each and every
tree, shrub and herb; we know its uses. If we were made to live in a land without
forests, then all this learning that we have cherished over the generations will be

gayana during the naval and divasa festivals, describing how the world was made,
how humans were born, from where the great river came.... We eat fish often. Fish is
our stand by when we have unexpected guests. The river brings us silt from upstream
which is deposited on the banks... Our children play on the river's banks, swim and
bathe there. Our cattle drink there all through the year for the big river never dries
up. In the belly of the river, we live contented lives. We have lived here for generation
after generation; do we have a right to the mighty river Narmada and to our forests
or don't we? Do you government people recognise that right or not?
You city people live in separate houses. You ignore each others' joys and sadness.
We live with our clan, our relatives, our kin. All of us pool together our labour and

Here in our villages, from our villagers, why do we get so much support? It is because
we are all alike here; we share a common understanding. Only a few are tenants;
everybody owns land. No one has a lot of land, but everyone has a little bit. When we
go to Gujarat, the big landowners will crush us. As early as forty-fifty years ago, they
took away the land of the adivasis who used to live there. Even now they are doing
this. And we strangers - we don't know the language or the customs; it is their rule.
If we can't do the kind of farming that needs a lot of money, then we'd have to
mortgage our land to them, and slowly they would take it over. If they took away the
land of the adivasis who lived there, then why won't they take away ours? Then who
will give us other land? This is the land of our forefathers. We have a right to it. If this
is lost, then we will only get spades and pickaxes, nothing else....

Our village gods are all here. Our ancestors' memorial stones are all here. We
worship Kalo Rano, Raja Panto, Indi Raja. We also worship Aai Khada and Khedu Bai.
Our great devi is Rani Kajol. Her’s and Kumbai and Kundu Rano's mountain is in
Mathvad. If we leave all of them, then where will we get new gods from? People
come from all over to celebrate our festivals - indal, divasa and divali. For bhangoria,
all of us go to the market where our youth choose their own spouses. Who will come
to us in Gujarat?

Development projects like the Sardar Sarovar dam have disrupted the lives and
livelihood of thousands of people. It is true that irrigation and power have been
produced and both are central to modern development. But for people who have
been displaced – and there are millions of them – modern development has been
unjust and destructive. Because of modern development projects, they have lost
access to their greatest resource, the local The Environment. This is a point that
Bava Mahaliya makes over and over again. Without the local The Environment,
their lives would be reduced to nothing. From a state of self-sufficiency, they
would be flung into scarcity. Now they can atleast take one crop and hope that, in
the future, irrigation would enable them to gradually move to multiple cropping.
But with displacement, their lives would become dependent on external forces and
they would fall into poverty.
For most rural communities, the link between the The Environment and the
lives of the people is very strong. Access to The Environment serves a large number
of their needs (like food, firewood, fodder, economically valuable articles etc.)
which otherwise they would have to pay for. As they lose this access to The
Environment either because of displacement, or becuase the The Environment is
destroyed and polluted, the poor are the greatest sufferers. The question of The
Environment and sustainability is intimately connected to the issue of equity.
It is also important to realise that not only do people lose out as they are
removed from their local The Environments. The Environment is equally denuded
of its rich bio-diversity as traditional knowledge is lost along with the people. The
stock of knowledge has been built and enriched over generations. People like
Bava Mahaliya are the repositories of traditional knowledge. “We know the name
of each and every tree, shrub and herb;
we know its uses. If we were made to

Chipko Movement
Another important environmental movement is the Chipko
Movement which started in the early 1970s in the Garhwal
Himalayas of Uttarakhand by Sunderlal Bahuguna. Like the tribal
people of Narmada valley, the forests are a critical resource for the
subsistence of people in hilly and mountainous areas. This is both
because of their direct provision of food, fuel and fodder and because of their role in stabilising soil and water resources. As these
forests were being increasingly felled for commerce and industry,
villagers sought to protect their livelihoods through non-violent
resistance. The name of the movement comes from the word
`chipko’ meaning 'embrace': the villagers hugged the trees, saving
them by interposing their bodies between them and the contractors' axes. Village
women were the main force of this movement. It inspired many people to look closely
at the issue of The Environment sustainability.

about the issue of displacement and the Environmental movement that has built up
around this and similar issues in the chapter on Social Movements.
While each of these movements has slightly different contexts, they are
essentially demanding the rights of the local communities over The Environment.

forest rights that were threatened by contractors. Narmada Bachao Andolan has

For long, policymakers have ignored the Environmental issues. The argument
has been that since developing countries like India are poor, developing economies
need to grow. Development has to be achieved at any cost. It is argued that growth in
GDP and modern industrial development are necessary, for raising the living standards
of people and reducing poverty. Since modern industrial and agricultural development
are intensive in use of natural resources including energy, the depletion of these
resources and pollution of The Environment is to be expected. It is a sacrifice that
has to be borne for higher growth. Once the high economic growth and prosperity is
achieved, pollution and the Environmental degradation can be handled. One can spend
money and clean up the air and rivers, drink bottled water and build cars that are fuel
efficient. After all, this is the route that the developed countries have taken.
This logic is wrong for various reasons. By now, you would have realised that
The Environment is already in a disastrous state on various fronts. India is a big
country with a huge population. If we continue to grow and consume energy and
other resources and also pollute The Environment as the developed countries have
done, it would be catastrophic for earth. The damage to The Environment will
simply not be reversible. Hence, the idea that the Environmental damage is selfcorrecting is wrong. Besides, we certainly do not want The Environment to be
destroyed before it is reclaimed. Future generations, even if they restore the damage,
would have to spend crores of rupees to clean up the mess created today. For
example, to clean up our rivers and drains, we need to spend money today besides
ensuring that they are not polluted again and any further. Do you think we should
follow a path that destroys the natural resources and
leaves them worse for future generations? Can we
not perceive the contradiction: we first encourage
and celebrate a lifestyle that invites the disease and
then spend thousands of rupees on its cure?
We are already experiencing the negative
consequences of rapid economic growth on several
fronts – the problem of groundwater and pesticides
being two stark examples. We have several thousands
of communities living off The Environment. To
destroy The Environment means to destroy these
communities. It is unjust to ask the poor people to
bear the cost of development.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that we don’t
progress. But we should be able to integrate the
Environmental concerns with the idea of progress,

find an the Environmentally sustainable pathway out of poverty. It is not an easy
task. And yet the beginnings have already been made.
1. Different groups have championed the rights of local people over The
Environment (chapter 20). They have been a major force in raising the
Environmental consciousness among people and shift towards sustainable
development.
2. The courts have given a number of judgments upholding the right to a healthy
The Environment as intrinsic to the Fundamental Right to Life. In 1991, the
Supreme Court held that the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution
includes the right to pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life.
The government is responsible for setting up laws and procedures that can
check pollution and introduce heavy fines for those who pollute. A variety of
government institutions have been started to play the regulatory role.

Fig 11.6 : Emissions from vehicles are a major cause of
environmental pollution. In a series of rulings (1998 onwards),
the Supreme Court had ordered all public transport vehicles
using diesel were to switch to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).
This is a cleaner fuel compared to diesel. As a result of this move,
air pollution in cities like Delhi came down considerably.
However, in the recent years the pollution levels have gone up
again, because of the huge rise in the number of private cars run
on diesel. Car manufacturers have started producing and selling
cars run on diesel! The challenge of sustainable development is

3. On issues like climate change, countries have tried to reach collective
decisions. Climate change affects all countries and people, some may be
more than the others. W do not even understand and cannot anticipate many of
these effects right now. Individually, a country may take an initiative to reduce
emissions of green house gases. Its The Environment would, however, continue
to deteriorate if other countries do not regulate their emissions. Thus, solutions
at the global level with countries coming together become necessary.
4. At the community level, many community organisations have innovated and
re-discovered sustainable and equitable ways of doing things. There are
numerous instances of such initiatives in diverse fields: fisheries, mining,
transportation, energy, agriculture, industry, etc. Let’s consider a few initiatives
that have a direct bearing on society’s most basic need i.e. food.
In the area of agricultural production, you might have heard about organic
products and organic farming. Organic farmers forego the use of chemical fertilisers
and pesticides. Instead, they rely mainly on natural techniques such as crop rotation,
compost and biological pest control in farming. One of the main characteristics of
organic agriculture is the use of local resources including on-farm biological
processes such as availability of pest predators (birds, spiders, insects) or soil

micro-organisms (Rhizobium and Azotobacter) which make nutrients more
accessible to the plant. The use of synthetic chemical inputs is minimised and
farms can be bio-diverse as they produce a number of crops rather than only one or
two crops. Furthermore, production levels can be maintained similar to modern
agricultural methods.
Now, many states have realised the need and potential of organic farming. Local
level initiatives have influenced state policy. The Sikkim government has taken the
bold step to ban chemical fertilisers and pesticides. It is the first state in India that
is planning to shift completely to organic farming by 2015. Uttarakhand too is
following the same path of being 100% organic state.
Another very interesting intervention on sustainable food production and its
equitable distribution is the alternate PDS initiated by community groups in
Zaheerabad area of Telangana.

Of the total cultivatable land in India, 92 million hectares is rainfed area and
51 million is irrigated area. This means nearly 2/3rd of cultivable land in India
is rain-fed and may not be fit for irrigated agriculture. Traditionally, a mix of
crops suited to the dryland conditions were grown in these areas. For example
the dryland agriculture of the Deccan plateau had a mixture of 16 crops sown at
the same time. These have varying maturity period which results in extended
period of work and continuous supply of incomes and/ or food gave. This also
minimised the risk factor, where at least one crop will give yield even in adverse
climatic conditions. Mixed cropping also reduced the chance of any insect
becoming a major pest. The crops were so chosen to provide balanced and
nutritious food to the land (soil fertility), human population and the livestock.
However, with the green revolution emphasis shifted to rice and wheat. These
were the crops that were also available through the ration shops under the PDS.
The main cereal cooked at home changed to rice and wheat. As the demand for
local foodgrains fell, over time many of the patches of dryland were left
uncultivated. You may recall that under the Green Revolution rice and wheat
agriculture was encouraged for food self-sufficiency through various government
policies. Cultivation of millets on the other hand was neither encouraged, nor
supported. There was not enough research on how to increase the yields of coarse
cereals. This is the main reason why the production of dryland crops like millets
and oil seeds suffered.
In Zaheerabad mandal of Medak district of Telangana, villagers have
reversed the dependence on purchased wheat and rice. It all began around
the year 2000 as the women began to reflect on the loss of local food cultures.
Millets were the traditional staple of the region, which had been lost to rice.
Rice is nutritionally inferior compared to millets. Besides poor nutrition, people
also realised that they had lost control on what grew on their land. Many
fields were now fallow. Led by a voluntary organisation, Deccan Development
Society, the villagers collectively decided to cultivate the fallow land and the
commons. Millets were the obvious crop choice because of their suitability to
the local The Environment. Millets are hardy crops and nutritious.
Cultivation of dryland gave people work. Further, instead of selling the
produce outside, the community started community grain bank. This operated
on the principle of the PDS system (like people hold different ration cards and
are assigned fixed quoatas depending on the type of ration card). Only it was
locally managed, and the grain was the local grain. Instead of the grain travelling
hundreds of kilometers, locally produced food was now available to ensure
food security in the village.

We noted that modern development has accentuated the problems of the
Environmental destruction. This is today felt in many ways and quite starkly. From
development centered on growth of goods and services, the goal has to shift towards
sustainable development with equity. Everyone has a role to play in this

Some other countries like the USA adopted liberal
democracy which ensured political liberty for all with
multiparty democracy. They promoted capitalist system
in which all means of production were owned by private
persons.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the world was
divided into developed industrialised countries of the
West (including Britain, USA, Germany, France, Italy,

These countries were under the control of developed
nations. The industrialised countries had split into two

Causes for the World Wars

Aggressive Nationalism

AN

The First World War began in 1914.
It was really a World War because almost
all the countries (imperial nations and
their colonies) of the world took part in
the war. China, Japan on the East and the
US on the West took part in the war. The
First World War ended in 1918. Britain

which led to the occurrence of world

The ideology of nationalism was a positive impulse. Many newly formed
modern nations were created in Europe because of people’s strong feeling of
nationalism. It was also the force behind the unification of Germany and Italy. But
this ideology created pride in these nations and hatred against the neighbouring
countries.
Italian Fascism and National Socialism of German Nazis were the other forms
of aggressive nationalism in destructive mode from 1923. Fascists promoted
aggressive nationalism and the image of victorious Germany ruling over the world.
They also mobilized the Germans against the other nations of Europe.

Imperialism

With the growth of industrial capitalism, European countries like Britain,
Germany and US needed to access raw materials and markets for their products.
They wanted to invest their growing capital in the colonies. Thus, by the end of the
19th century there was a race for colonies between the European powers. The
newly emerged industrial powers (like Germany and Italy) wanted to re-divide the
colonies but the old industrial powers were not ready for this. This created a lot
of tension often leading to wars.

The Russian Socialist Revolution (1917-1922)

Russia was ruled by Tsars (emperors) in early 20th century. It was a vast area of
land spread over two continents, Europe and Asia. Therefore it had been called a
Euro-Asian power. It had the third largest population in the world, viz. 156 million,
after China and India. It comprised of several nations like Russia, Ukraine,
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan etc. The livelihood of most
Russians came from agriculture. Often there were struggles between peasants and
feudal lords for control over land. The feudal lords owned most of the lands and
most peasants paid rent for the land they tilled.
Tsar Nicholas II ruled over his vast Russian empire with the help of the army
and bureaucracy. But the Russian economy had suffered a lot by the first World
War. The Russian army was the largest in the world before World War I. Yet, by
1917, Russia had lost the lives of two million soldiers and civilians. It became the

War I. A large amount of food was
supplied to the War front during the war.
This led to the shortage of food in the
cities. On March 8 th 1917, around
10,000 women of the capital
St Petersburg, took out a procession
demanding ‘Peace and Bread’. Workers
also joined them in this protest. Tsar
Nicholas II was really upset by these
protests. He ordered the army to
suppress the demonstrators, even by
firing at them. Instead, the soldiers also
joined the demonstrators. In just two
days, the situation became so bad that
the Tsar left his throne and escaped.
Russians made a Provisional
government. This was the first Russian

Russia. The common people were tired
of the military action and economic

These Soviets of soldiers, industrial
workers and people in rural areas were

These groups represented the common

25, 1917, reached the village the following day and
was greeted with enthusiasm; to the peasants it
meant free land and an end to the war. ...The day the
news arrived, the landowner’s house was looted, his
stock farms were “requisitioned” and his vast orchard
was cut down and sold to the peasants for wood; all
his far buildings were torn down and left in ruins
while the land was distributed among the peasants
who were prepared to live the new Soviet life’. From:
Fedor Belov, The History of a Soviet Collective Farm

Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924)

Bolsheviks were able to get the
support of the Soviets because
they demanded for immediate and
unconditional peace. They also
demanded that all the land should
be nationalized and redistributed
to the peasants. Bolsheviks
wanted control over prices and
nationalisation of all factories and
banks. The Soviets under the
Bolshevik leadership seized

war and redistributed land. Russia

peace because a civil war was
started. This war was led by White
armies of Russian monarchists
and anti- communist soldiers with
help from Britain, France, USA
and Japan. They were all defeated
by 1920. The Bolsheviks also
announced the end of the Russian
empire and permitted the various
nations under it to become
independent. However, gradually

The Economic Depression began around the end of 1929 and lasted almost till
1939 when the Second World War started. During this decade, the economy declined
worldwide because of a decline in demand and fall in prices. Factories were closed
because the demand was low.
Since the goods were
manufactured in limited quantity,
the prices increased. Because of
expensive goods, people’s
purchasing power reduced. So the
demand for goods further went
down. This cyclical effect caused
massive unemployment. The real
incomes of ordinary people as

world also declined. Initially a
stock market collapsed in the US, but very soon it affected almost every country.
In America, as many as 25% people and nearly 33% people in many other
countries were unemployed. As factories closed down and trade declined, cities
became centers of decline. This led to reduced prices (up to 60%) for agricultural
produce causing pauperisation of millions of farmers and stopping of cultivation.
This was the longest and worst economic decline faced by modern economy till

Economists and politicians have discussed the causes of this decline, ways to
get over it and possible ways of preventing it from happening again. Marxist
economists argued that this kind of crises happened because of capitalism. They
also thought that it could be prevented by the establishment of socialism. On the
other hand, economists like JM Keynes argued that the state is responsible to keep
the economy going. If it fails to do so, it can lead to situations of depression. Keynes
argued that during economic decline, when demand decreases, the state should invest
funds and generate employment which will help people to earn money and demand
goods in the market. This generation of demand through state action will help the
economy to revive.

Franklin Roosevelt, who became the President of US,
announced “the New Deal” which promised Relief to the

undertaking large public works. However, when the war
started, state expenditure on armies and armaments suddenly
increased. This increased the factory production and
demand for farm produce. He also introduced the much

permanent system of universal retirement pensions (Social
Security), and unemployment insurance. It also gave welfare Fig 12.5: Famous photograph

still on. These basically consisted of unemployment
insurance and old age pension schemes. Towards the end of the Second World War,
Britain also adopted many social security measures like unemployment doles,
sickness coverage, health schemes, child care etc. All this made up the idea of a
Welfare State, a state which ensured a basic minimum dignified life for all citizens.
It also took care of their most elementary needs like food, housing, health, child
and old age care and education. The state had taken on the responsibility of providing
employment to the able bodied citizens. In this way, the state tried to reduce the
effects of the ups and downs of market based capitalism.

Rise of Fascism, Nazism

AL

AN

A

Fascism was one ideology which developed in the period after the First World
War, especially in the defeated countries. It emphasised the idea of national unity
in order to expand and win over other nations. Fascists didn’t allow anyone to
conflict nor have different interests within the nation. They suppressed people
with force in order to ensure absolute loyalty and obedience to a central power.
They were against both communism and liberalism. Fascists wanted to build unity
in their nations through a dictatorial state that promoted the mass mobilization of
the majority community of the nation. Fascist movements shared certain common
features, like the worshipping of the state, a devotion to a strong leader like Hitler,
and an emphasis on extreme nationalism and military conquest. Fascism used
political violence, war, and conquest as a means to achieve national revival. It also
asserted that stronger nations have the right, and indeed a duty, to expand their
territory by displacing weaker nations. It stood for state controlled capitalism and
opposed socialism and communism. It also stood for abolition of all private
industries.

This ideology was more popular in the defeated countries who were feeling
insulted because of the conditions imposed on them by the Versailles treaty and
the pressure of world-wide depression. It first began with the victory of Benito
Mussolini in Italy in 1922; then Hitler and his Nazi Party came to power in Germany
in 1933; General Franco came to power in Spain after a long military campaign
against the democratic state in 1939; meanwhile Japan is also developed its own
version of fascist ideology i.e. militarism and started its military campaigns in
China, Korea etc. All these dictators were, in some ways, followers of the Fascist
ideology.
Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved many people.
He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of the Versailles Treaty
and restore the dignity of the German people. He promised employment for those
looking for work, and a secure future for the youth. He promised to remove all
foreign influences and fight all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.
Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the importance of rituals
and spectacle to mobilise the masses. Nazis held massive rallies and public meetings
to demonstrate the support for Hitler and create a sense of unity among the people.

after the speeches were all part of this display
of power. Hitler mobilized his supporters by
promising to establish the racial supremacy
of Aryans (Germans) over the world. He also
targeted minority communities like Jews,
Gypsies etc, as the main cause of all
problems. Since the Gypsies were nomadic
and some Jews owned pawn shops and lent
money, many middle class Germans could be
turned against them. He also attacked
Communism and Capitalism terming both of
them as Jewish conspiracies. He promised
to build a strong state which would fight with
both of them. He appealed especially to the
middle class who felt threatened by
capitalism and the Great Depression. Hitler
was also opposed to working class movement
led by the Communists and Socialists.

From Hitler’s speech
Hitler argued that it is the right of the
most powerful race to conquer the world;
‘For this earth is not allotted to anyone nor is it presented to anyone as a gift.
It is awarded by providence to people who
in their hearts have the courage to conquer it, the strength to preserve it, and
the industry to put it to the plough… The
primary right of this world is the right to
life, so far as one possesses the strength
for this. Hence on the basis of this right a
vigorous nation will always find ways of
adapting its territory to its population
size.

In such a situation, Nazi Party’s
propaganda gave some hopes of a better future. Hitler was the unquestioned leader
of the Nazi party. In 1928, the Nazi Party had got less than 2. 6 per cent votes in the
Reichstag – the lower house of
the German parliament. But by
1932, it had become the largest
party in Germany with 37 per cent
votes.

Hitler came to power and
immediately took steps to
establish an undemocratic and
autocratic rule. He stopped the
working of all democratic
institutions like Parliament. This
included arbitrary arrest of
political opponents, especially the
Communists and putting them in
concentration camps.

Women under Nazis
In an address to women at the Nuremberg Party Rally, 8 September 1934, Hitler said:
We do not consider it correct for the woman to interfere in the world of the man, in
his main sphere. We consider it natural that these two worlds remain distinct…What
the man gives in courage on the battlefield, the woman gives in eternal self-sacrifice, in
eternal pain and suffering. Every child that women bring to the world is a battle, a
battle waged for the existence of her people.
Hitler at the Nuremberg Party Rally, 8 September 1934, also said:
‘The woman is the most stable element in the preservation of a folk…she has the
most unerring sense of everything that is important to not let a race disappear because it is her children who would be affected by all this suffering in the first place…That
is why we have integrated the woman in the struggle of the racial community just as
nature and providence have determined so.’
Do you agree with the view that
women should confine themselves to
pain and suffering of bringing up the
children?
Do you think men and women can
participate equally in all aspects of
life including child rearing and work
in factories, offices, and fields?

also created sub-human conditions of life for those who
were tortured by the racist regime. This was also followed
by heavy investment in armament industry to create further
employment. But this plan could be sustained only by
going on war with the neighbours. For this, Hitler followed
an aggressive foreign policy to recover the territories lost
by Germany after the First World War. Then by 1939, he
attacked Poland and as we saw earlier, this started off the
Second World War.
As the War proceeded, the Nazi regime started its

The Treaty of Versailles- Intensity of the terms

SC

T,

At the end of World War I, the Conference on Peace took place in Versailles in

1919. This was the biggest conference of that time as it was attended by delegations
from 32 nations that covered three-fourths of the population of the world. The five
victorious powerful countries of the time, viz. USA, UK, France, Italy and Japan,
participated in this conference. But Socialist Russia and the defeated powers, for
example, Germany, Austria and Turkey, were not invited to the Conference. To
weaken Germany, the Treaty of Versailles imposed some territorial penalties and
military cuts on it. Firstly, Germany was asked to return its colonies in Africa
occupied in the 1880s and European areas like Alsace and Lorraine which they had
occupied from France in 1871. Secondly, it was asked to pull down its army strength
to 100,000 from 900,000 during World War I. It was also asked not to have

tonnes and a dozen torpedo missiles carriers and destroyers. It is not surprising,
therefore, that Germans thought the Treaty at Versailles was a diktat imposed on
them and they had no respect or responsibility for it.

German challenge to vengeful domination
After Germany’s defeat at the end of the First World War in 1919, the victorious

Allies wanted to punish Germany for starting the war and cripple it so that it could
not rise again. For Germany, the conditions forced on them by the Treaty of
Versailles were slavish. This created an aversive desire in Germany which led to
the rise of Hitler and his Nazi party. They wanted to get back the territories lost by
them in the Treaty of Versailles. They also wanted to restore German control over
Central Europe and end the restrictions on German arms. Germany rebuilt its
industries under the Nazis and developed a massive army and armament industry
which could only be served by a war.

USSR joined the war against Germany and Japan.

The Defeat and The End
The initial victories of the German armies were turned back after they were

defeated in the famous Battle of Stalingrad in early 1943. People all over Eastern
Europe welcomed Soviet forces as the liberators from the hated Nazi rule. They
eventually captured Berlin, the capital of Germany. Hitler and his close associates
committed suicide to avoid being captured and tried. Eventually Germany was
divided into two parts: the eastern part was named German Democratic Republic
(GDR) and the western portion was named Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).

China: Two Different Phases

SC

At the beginning of the 20th century, China was ruled by emperors of Manchu
dynasty. Manchu dynasty was unsuccessful in defending the interests of China from
the western colonial powers. These powers had become very powerful and influential
in different parts of China. They had also forced the emperors to give them economic
and political concessions like low import taxes, immunity from Chinese laws,
maintaining armed forces, etc. The common people as well as the administrators of
the empire were unhappy with this. The administrators tried to reform the systems.
The people also revolted against the domination of the western powers.

Establishing the Republic
The Manchu empire was overthrown in 1911and a republic was established
under Sun-Yat-Sen (1866-1925). Yat-Sen is regarded as the founder of modern
China. He came from a poor family and studied in missionary schools where he
was introduced to democracy and Christianity. He studied medicine but he was
greatly concerned about the fate of China. He studied the problems of China and
designed a programme of action. His programme was called the Three Principles
(San min chui). These principles were: “nationalism” – this meant overthrowing
the Manchu dynasty, which was seen as a foreign dynasty, as well as other western
imperialists; “democracy” or establishing democratic government; and “socialism”
which meant controlling industries and land reforms to distribute land to the landless
peasants. Even after the Manchu dynasty was overthrown and a republic was declared,
the republican government led by Sun-Yat-Sen was unable to come to power. The
country was soon controlled by regional military powers called “war lords”.

After the republican revolution, the country entered a

People’s Party also called as Kuo-Min-Tang (KMT) and
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) emerged as two
major parties. Both the parties wanted to unite the country
and bring stability. The Kuo-Min-Tang followed the
political philosophy based on Sun Yat-sen’s ideas. They
identified the ‘four great needs’ as clothing, food, housing
and transportation. After the death of Sun, Chiang-Kai-Shek
(1887-1975) emerged as the leader of the Guomindang.
He launched a military campaign in China to control the
‘warlords’ and to eliminate the communists. Warlords
were regional leaders who had forcefully taken control
and authority. Chiang also wanted to militarise the nation.

The Guomindang’s (KMT) social base was in urban areas of China. Industrial
growth was slow and limited at that time. By 1919, an industrial working class of
around 5, 00,000 people had appeared in cities like Shanghai. These cities later
became the centre of modern growth. However, only a small percentage of these
people were employed in modern industries such as ship building. Most were ‘petty
urbanites’ (xiao shimin), traders and shopkeepers. Urban workers, particularly
women, earned very low wages. They were now organising themselves into trade
unions. Working hours were long and conditions of work were bad. As ideas of
freedom became popular, there was a growing concern with women’s rights, ways
to build a family based on equality and discussions about love and romance. Many
schools and universities came up to help in the social and cultural change (Peking
University was established in 1902). Journalism also started reflecting the growing
attraction of this new thinking.
Chiang was a conservative and he encouraged women to have the four virtues
of ‘chastity, appearance, speech and work’. He thought that women’s roles should
be limited to the household. Even the length of hemlines worn by women (frock
like dress for women) was prescribed. He also tried to suppress the trade union
movements to encourage factory owners. The Guomindang, despite its attempts to
unite the country, failed because of its narrow social base and limited political
vision. A major plan in Sun Yat-sen’s

the problems faced by the people.
The Rise of the Communist Party of China
When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the Guomindang withdrew
themselves. The long and exhausting war had made China weak. Between 1945 and
1949, prices rose 30 per cent per month. All this had completely destroyed the
lives of ordinary people. Rural China faced two crises: one ecological, with soil
exhaustion, deforestation and floods, and the second, a socio-economic one caused
by exploitation through land-tenure systems, indebtedness, primitive technology
and poor communications.
The CCP had been founded in 1921, soon after the Russian Revolution. The
success of the Russian revolution had a powerful influence around the world. Leaders
such as Lenin established the Comintern in March 1918 to help bring together a
world government that would end exploitation. The Comintern and the Soviet Union
supported communist parties around the world. But they followed the traditional
Marxist idea that only the working class in the cities could bring a revolution.

Mao Zedong (1893-1976) emerged
as a major CCP leader. He took a
different path by basing his
revolutionary programme on the
peasantry. He organised the Chinese
peasants to fight for abolition of
landlordism. He also built an army of
peasants. Millions of landless peasants
joined the struggle led by CCP. His
success made the CCP a powerful
political party. It ultimately won against
the Guomindang. Mao Zedong’s radical
approach can be seen in Jiangxi, in the

mountains, where they camped from
1928 to 1934, secure from Guomindang attacks. A strong peasants’ council (soviet)
was organised. This council united through confiscation and redistribution of land
of landlords. Mao, unlike other leaders, stressed the need for an independent
government and army. He had become aware of women’s problems and supported
the emergence of rural women’s associations. He also promoted a new marriage
law that forbade arranged marriages, stopped purchase or sale of marriage contracts
and simplified divorce.
The Communists’ Soviet party was forced to find another base for themselves
because of the Guomindang blockade. They went on a Long March (1934-35) which
was a gruelling and difficult journey of 6,000 miles to Shanxi. They set up their
new base in Yanan. Here, they further developed their programme to end warlordism,
carry out land reforms and fight foreign imperialism. This twin agenda of land
reform and nationalisation made them successful and made a strong social base
for them.
Japan attacked and occupied much of China between 1937 and 1945. They
tried to impose a cruel colonial military rule over China. This had a disastrous
impact on the Chinese society and economy. Both Guomindang and CCP now tried
to join together to fight Japanese occupation. After the surrender of Japan to the
US in August 1945, Guomindang and CCP fought a war for control over China.
Eventually, CCP was successful in establishing its rule over mainland China while
Guomindang was forced to set up its government on the island of Taiwan.

Establishing the New Democracy: 1949-1954
The Peoples Republic of China government was established in 1949. It was
based on the principles of the ‘New Democracy’. This new principle was an
association of all social classes who were opposed to landlordism and imperialism.
Important areas of the economy were put under government control. Once in power,
the CCP started large scale land reform measures. They took away the land of

landlords and distributing them among poor peasants. The new government also managed
to enact laws to protect women, their rights and abolition of polygamy. This enabled
women to assume new roles and enjoy equal status vis a vis men in various fields.
Land Reforms
Land reform was launched in 1950-51 after two years of relatively peaceful
attempts to understand rural situation and forming peasant associations etc. The
major steps were: a class identification of all the
people living in the villages, followed by the
confiscation and redistribution of landlord land and
other productive property. Work teams that were

positions. This new leadership was mostly from the

were more skilled. In addition, the work teams

As an economic reform program, about 43 percent of China’s cultivated land
was successfully redistributed to about 60 percent of the rural population. Even though
the holdings of poor peasants substantially increased, the middle peasants actually
benefited the most from land reform because of their stronger initial position.
The old elite had to lose its economic assets and power while a new elite class
of village people emerged from poor and middle classes. These people had been
brought into political work by the CCP. Along with the land reforms, another big
effort was the setting up of adult peasant schools to spread literacy and political

Nigeria today was actually created by the British
by bringing together different regions around the Niger
river system where people of different tribal groups lived.
Northern Nigeria is dominated by Hausa-Fulani people who
are predominantly Muslims. The South Eastern part of Nigeria
is dominated by Igbo (pronounced as eebo) tribes while the South Western portions
are dominated by Yoruba tribes. While the people in southern areas are mostly
Christians due to long years of missionary activity, many people still practice tribal
religious beliefs. Before a common democratic political system was built, modern
Nigeria faced many conflicts between these three regions. Today also, the legacy
of colonialism continues in Nigeria because of European control over its natural
resources, especially petroleum.
The region of river Niger is one of the most densely populated countries of
Africa. This region has suffered from different kinds of colonial rule. From the
16th century onwards, it was a major source of slaves for America. Tribal peasants
were captured in the interior of the forests and sold to European slave traders.
After slave trade was abolished in 19th century, a new interest developed for colonial
powers in the trade of the agricultural produce of this area, especially palm oil and
cocoa. The British established their rule over the coastal areas in 1861. They
developed Lagos as their centre of administration, trade and education in Western
Africa. The struggle against colonialism also started in Lagos and Pan Africanism
and Nigerian Nationalism emerged here.
Racism became common in the British colonial empire in late 19th and early
20th centuries. Educated Africans were excluded from the civil service, and there
was discrimination against African entrepreneurs. At the same time, the authorities
from ruling country gave control to the tribal chiefs and elite and promoted them.

South Nigeria got access to modern education and administrative modernisation
but pre-modern traditions continued in the north. Because of this, many differences
came up between the two regions. The north was not able to develop a modern

Macaulay also supported militant attacks on the British colonial government. In

After the wave of nationalism in Nigeria, the British decided to hand over power
to the Nigerians. They made a complex federal system which made the three major
regions of Nigeria autonomous. Nigeria became independent on 1st October, 1963.
Unfortunately, a just and democratic balance could not happen. Soon civil war started
in Nigeria. Military rule started soon and
reinforced the domination of the north.
People made many attempts to bring in
civilian and democratic governments but
these failed again and again. The military
regime and multinational Oil corporations
which funded the corrupt rulers worked
together. They spread corruption and
suppression of human rights in Nigeria.
After a long period of military
dictatorship, Nigerians elected a
democratic government in 1999. It remains to be seen how it faces the challenges
of building a democratic Nigeria.

people get very little benefit from this. In addition, the coastal
environment of Nigeria has been disturbed because of reckless
oil extraction by foreign oil companies. Oil spillage from oil
wells has a major impact on the ecosystem. Large areas of the
mangrove forests, which are especially susceptible to oil, have
been destroyed. This is mainly because oil is stored in the soil
and re-released annually. Around 5–10% of Nigerian mangrove
ecosystems have been destroyed either by clearing or oil. Spills
destroy crops and aqua culture through contamination of the
groundwater and soil. Drinking water is also frequently
contaminated, and sheen of oil is visible in many local bodies of

You have read about the Second World War already. When the war started in
1939, most of the provinces of India were governed by Congress ministries. The
British government had agreed to give the Indians the right to rule themselves to
some extent. The British parliament passed the Government of India Act in 1935.

Now that the Indian people were revolting against the British rule, they were
upset. They looked for ways to punish the Congress and make it weak and unpopular
among the people. The British started questioning the right of the Congress to
represent the people of the country. Now, they followed the ‘Divide and Rule Policy’
more vigorously.
To achieve this, the British government supported and encouraged the plans of
the Muslim League and gave little importance to the Congress. In this period, the
Muslim League and its leaders like M. A. Jinnah became more active in mass
politics.

The Muslim League

Muslim League was formed in 1906. Till the 1930s, it mainly represented the
interests of Muslim landlords of UP and did not have much mass support. It had
demanded that the British should create separate seats in all councils for which
only Muslims would vote. It had argued that since the majority people in many
areas were Hindus, there were more chances of Hindus getting elected to councils.
If this happened, Muslims would not be able to protect their interests in the
government. But, if a certain number of seats were reserved for Muslims for which
only the Muslim population of an area would vote, these Muslim members would
be able to raise the concerns and problems of Muslims. The Congress had accepted
this logic and separate electorates were implemented from 1909. When provincial

governments were elected in 1937, the League won 102 of the 482 Muslim seats
in the country. However, the Congress also fought elections on the Muslim seats
because it believed that it was a national party and not a party of only Hindus. The
Congress won 26 out of the 58 Muslim seats it had contested.

seats.
What happened to the Muslim population in the years between 1937 and 1947?
The League pointed out many issues. It blamed that Congress was insensitive to
the needs of Muslims. For example, the Congress refused to form a coalition
government with the Muslim League in the United Provinces where it too had won
many seats. The Congress had banned its members from taking membership of the
Muslim League. Congress members could be members of the Hindu Mahasabha
before. But this was also banned from 1938, only after objections from Muslim
Congressmen like Maulana Azad. Thus, the League created the impression that
Congress was basically a Hindu party and did not want to share power with the
Muslims.

The Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS
During this period, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh
(RSS), a national cultural organisation were mobilizing the Hindus. These
organisations wished to unite all the Hindus and overcome the divisions of caste
and sect to reform their social life. They also gave out the message that India was
the land of the Hindus who were in a majority. Many Congressmen were also
impressed with the activities of these organisations.

the messages and activities of organisations like the Muslim League, the Hindu
Mahasabha and the RSS. Congress argued that Hindus and Muslims were not people
of two different nations, but part and parcel of one Indian nation. However, the
British were eagerly listening to the fears of the League about Hindu domination
and suggesting ways to make the Muslims secure.

The “Pakistan” Resolution

AN

A

Many people now felt that the separate governing arrangements were needed
for regions where Muslims were in majority. For example, the Urdu poet
Mohammad Iqbal, the writer of the song “Sare Jahan Se Achha Hindustan
Hamara”, spoke of a need for a “North- West Indian Muslim state” in his
presidential address to the Muslim League in 1930.

address the fears of Muslims. On 23 March
1940, the Muslim League moved a resolution and demanded autonomy for the
parts of the subcontinent where Muslim were in majority. This ambiguous resolution
never mentioned partition or Pakistan. However, in later years, it became known
as the Pakistan resolution. People were thinking of different ways to solve the
issues raised by the League and a new nation state of Pakistan was one among
these alternatives. But since the discussions and negotiations were not working
out, the idea of a separate nation state of Pakistan became stronger. The Congress
was unable to fulfill the demands of M A Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League.
From 1940 to 1946, the League convinced Muslim masses about the benefits
and need for a separate nation. Peasants could imagine a state where Hindu zamindars
and moneylenders did not exploit them. Traders, businessmen and job seekers could
think of a state where competition from Hindu traders, businessmen and job seekers

By 1941, Japan had started expanding into South East Asia. This was clear
threat to Indian territories as well. The British wanted Indian people to support it in
the war against Japan. In March 1942, Prime Minister Churchill was persuaded to
send one of his ministers, Sir Stafford Cripps, to India to try and make a compromise
with Gandhi and the Congress. But these talks failed after the Congress insisted
that the Viceroy should first appoint an Indian as the Defence Member of his
Executive Council.
After the failure of the Cripps Mission, Mahatma Gandhi decided to launch his
third major movement against the British rule. This was the “Quit India” campaign.
This campaign began in August 1942. Although Gandhi was sent to jail, other younger
activists organised strikes and acts of sabotage all over the country. The young
men and women left their colleges to go to jail in very large numbers. Socialist
members of the Congress, such as Jayaprakash Narayan, were particularly active
in the underground resistance movement. In several districts, such as Satara in the
west and Medinipur in the east, “independent” governments were declared. The
British responded with a lot of force, yet it took them more than a year to suppress
this rebellion.
The Communist Party of India, in the meanwhile, decided to support the British
war effort. It was alarmed at the attack on the Soviet Union by the Nazis. It realised
the danger at a world level and called the war a People’s War. On the contrary,
Gandhi felt that Indians would be able to handle Japan on their own after the British
leave India.
The initial victories of Japan against the Americans and Europeans created a
strong impression on the people in India. Firstly, it seemed that the European
colonialists would get defeated very soon. Secondly, Japan was an Asian country
and could stand up against the European colonialists. Indians felt that they too can
stand up and fight against Britain decisively. The myth that the British race was
superior than others was destroyed in the minds of people.
Subhash Chandra Bose wanted to take up the opportunity created by the
difficulties of the British. He said that India’s independence was of utmost
importance and we should take the help of the Japanese to throw out the British.
He went secretly to Germany and Japan and collected an army of Indian soldiers in
1942.

Muslim League and Congress - Negotiation for transfer of power

When political negotiations between top leaders began again in l945, the British
agreed to create an entirely Indian central Executive Council, except for the Viceroy
and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. They did this as a first step
towards full independence. Discussions about the transfer of power failed due to
Jinnah’s demand that the League should have an absolute right to choose all the
Muslim members of the Executive Council. This demand was not acceptable to
others. Most nationalist Muslims supported the Congress Party. The Unionist Party
of Punjab, which had a large number of Muslim members, did not agree with Muslim
League’s demand. In fact, Maulana Azad was the leader of the Congress Party
delegation for these discussions as he was the President of this party!

In 1946, elections were held for the Provincial Governments. The Muslim League

A possible alternative to Partition
In March 1946, the British Cabinet sent a three member mission team to Delhi
to examine the demand made by the League and suggest a suitable political
framework for Indian freedom. This Cabinet Mission toured the country for three
months and recommended a three-tier confederation but India was to remain united.
Initially, all the major parties accepted this plan. But the agreement was shortlived because the parties had different opinions of the plan. Ultimately, neither the

“Direct Action Day”.
On this day, riots started in Calcutta. These riots lasted for several days and several
thousand people died in the riots. By March 1947, violence spread to many parts
of northern India.
Because of the mass violence, the Congress agreed for dividing the Punjab
into two halves in March 1947. One half was to be with Muslim majority and the
other with Hindu/ Sikh majority. Congress also agreed for a similar division in
Bengal.
In February 1947, Mountbatten replaced Wavell and became the Viceroy.
Mountbatten started one last round of talks to find a solution. When these talk also
failed, he announced that British India would become freed but also would be divided.
Muslim majority areas of Punjab, NWFP, Sind, Baluchistan and East Bengal would
be made part of a new state of Pakistan. The formal transfer of power from British
Government to Pakistan would be done on 14th and to India, it would be done on
the 15th of August, 1947. This solution was the only workable solution to end the
year of riots, bloodshed and hatred that people were filled with.

Partition and migrations
Now that a Muslim nation, Pakistan, was created, a painful and unimaginable
situation arose for many people. Most Hindus living on Pakistani side of the border
felt insecure and forced to leave their homes. So did many Muslims, living on the
other side of this border. Not all the people wanted this, not all the people understood
why this was happening. They felt anger and hatred against each other for being
forced to move out of their homes, villages and cities. Around 1.5 crore people,
both Hindus and Muslims, were displaced. They killed, looted and burnt each other.

Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
On 15th August, 1947, Mahatma Gandhi, father of the nation, was trying to
bring peace to riot-torn Noahkhali (in Bengal). He came to the capital, Delhi, only
on 9th September, 1947. The old man was unhappy with the communal riots in
north-western India and tried to calm the fears and anger of the people. Yet,
some sections of people were annoyed with Gandhi for his role in Indian politics.
They disturbed his all-religion prayer meetings many times. An unsuccessful
attempt on his life was made two days before his actual assassination. It was on
28 January, 1948 that Gandhi said, “If I am to die by the bullet of a mad man, I
must do so smiling. There must be no anger within me. God must be in my heart
and on my lips.”
Finally, less than six months after Independence,
on the evening of 30th January, 1948, Gandhi was shot
with three bullets while going for his all-religion prayer
meeting. Before dying Gandhi said, ‘Hey Ram’. His
assassin, Nathuram Godse ran off from the scene of
crime and was later arrested in Bombay. He was once
a member of Hindu Mahasabha and because of his
actions, many became against this organisation.
Consequently, on 14th February, 1948, All India Hindu
Mahasabha decided to ‘suspend its political work and
concentrate on real organisational work’ instead. A
fanatic Godse had, thereby, hurt his own friends and
harmed his own mission.

Integration of States
Fig 14.8 : Mahatma Gandhi
There were around 550 Princely states in India.
These states enjoyed different levels of sovereignty but all were under British
power. As the British were going to withdraw from India, these princely states
were going to become independent. They were asked to decide if they wanted to
join India, Pakistan or remain independent. The ordinary people of the princely
states had become aware of democratic rights through participation in Praja Mandal
movements. They did not want the princely families to continue to rule over them.
In Travancore and Hyderabad, peasants were revolting with arms against the ruling
zamindars.
The Congress supported the movements of the people of the princely states
and declared that they should join India in making the new Constitution of the
country. Sardar Patel was given charge of this matter in July 1947. He began

discussions with the princes about the necessity to join India. He even made it
clear that if they did not do so, the army would have to be sent to complete the
process of unification. By 15th August 1947, all states except Kashmir, Hyderabad
and Junagadh had agreed to sign the Instrument of Accession with India. These three
states were also made to join in the next two years.
The government of these princely states was taken over and the princes were
given pension funds called privy-purse to meet their personal expenses. New
administrative units were created by combining different territories. The first phase
of this process of creating the new states of India went on till 1956. Interestingly,
in 1971, the government of India abolished the privy purses and titles used by the
former princely families.
The modern India that you know came into being. In 1947, it was a poor nation
with low human development indicators and bad infrastructural facilities. In two
centuries, colonialism had blocked the development of the country and tried to
destroy the self-confidence of its people. Building a modern self-dependent and
equitable nation in India was both a challenge and an opportunity.

There was a turn of events and new political aspirations during the last few
years of the British rule. That shaped the constitution. After 1936 Gandhi did not
take much interest in politics, mostly confined to ashram. However he was guiding
the events. Electoral politics began in 1936-37, and lasted with 1946 elections in
which members of Constituent Assembly were elected. The same members have
written the Constitution. The Congress remained a predominant political stream
standing for the unified Indian Nationalism encompassing all social segments and
it made huge strides in electoral politics also winning majority of seats in two
elections.
This period is also significant because during the elections religious nationalism
– Hindu and Muslim was born little earlier but strengthened as political force.
Both Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League contested the election propagated
religious ideas as politics and ideology. The third stream peasant nationalism has
grown as main opposition to the British and the princess under the Communist
party. The fourth one was emanated from the self-respect movement of Ramaswamy
Naikar in Tamil region and Non-Brahmin party of Bhaskar Rao Jadav in Maharastra.
In this backdrop Then All India Depressed Class movement developed and
strengthened under Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.
In this backdrop The Hindu leader B.S. Munje made friendly association with
outcast leaders. In February 1932 what is known as [M.C.] Rajah-[B.S.] Munje Pact
was signed in support of the joint electorate with Hindus. And finally on the pressures
of British functionaries including the then Viceroy, Ambedkar signed the Poona
Pact with Gandhi in 1932. The Depressed Class (DC) issue thus became part of the

national agenda and nation’s concern. The DCs became part of nationalist politics.
The DC leaders’ agenda came to prominence on the national political agenda. Many
more such organizations came into being in different parts of the country in Punjab
and Bengal. The temple entry movements were undertaken and further visiting the
untouchable’s residential quarters as part of the national movement adopted. In
this scenario, national movement was not meant just the independence from the
British but integration of the lower orders of the society into nationalist politics.
Ambedkar, in this new spirit started a new party All India Scheduled Caste
Federation in 1942. M.C. Rajah who was very close to Gandhi disappointed with
the Congress Governments joined the Federation. Sarat Chandra Bose brother of
Subhas Chandra Bose supported this movement. It indicates that the caste question
assumed importance thus Ambedkar has become national leader with issue of the
Depressed Class/Scheduled Caste. Ambedkar was considered to be a leader of
national stature. Ambedkar became the sole representative of Scheduled Castes,
and that has become an issue on par with Muslim question. The British Government
and its officials had recognized Ambedkar as legitimate representative of the SCs
and caste question in India.
In Special Scheduled Caste Political Conference held in Allahabad in December
1942 Ambedkar declared that India was not a nation but constellation of nations
warning the British and Congress that the Scheduled Caste would have their specific
identity. Ambedkar thus learnt to communicate with the top dominant nationalist
leadership of the country without sacrificing his intended politics.
In this debate in 1943 the Secretary of State for India opined that Ambedkar
emerged a national leader and said Ambedkar was “the right and only proper
representative of the Depressed Classes”. In November 1944 a Non-Party
Conference was held under Tej Bahdur Sapru to discuss the basis of future
constitution of India. It had invited Ambedkar to send a representative to be on the
sub-committee on par with other parties.
Further in May 1945 Ambedkar came to the dominant nationalist stance saying
that Constitution should be “framed by Indians for Indians with voluntary consent
of Indians”. At the same time he declared that “The Scheduled Castes stand for the
freedom of India and not for the Congress-High class Hindu rule”. At the same
time he categorized the people into “servile classes” and “governing classes”. That
means he divided people into social justice forces and the other Indians. He stepped
up his battle opening channels with mainstream nationalist politics and emerging
only sole leader with powerful backing of various social identities groups.
Independence has become an immediate issue and nation was in mood to attain
independence. Dr. Ambedkar too was interacting with the British and national

leaders. Even in this scenario political parties like Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha
had opened dialogue with him. This political turn had impacted the Constitution
making.
The British rulers under these circumstances agreed to constitute a Constituent
Assembly. Elections have come to elect members to CA through indirect elections
with limited franchise. The CA was constituted in July 1946 with 296 members
from all provinces. The Congress won 208 of 296 allotted to the provinces. Earlier
in Provincial elections in December 1945 Congress became victorious. The
Congress in this background clearly expressed its intention to behave like “mirror
of the nation” in Nehru’s words. Within the Congress the luminaries Jawaharlal
Nehru, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, and Moulana Abdul Kalam Azad emerged
prominent leaders of Constitution making. C. A. was constituted with Alladi Kuppu
Swamy Iyyar, N. Gopalaswamy Iyyengar and B. R. Ambedkar as experts on legal
issues. Ambedkar had many advantages he was historian, economist and expert of
law and constitutions of prominent countries, apart from this he emerged a social
justice ideologue and politician with stature on par with top Congress luminaries.
And above all he brought in the social justice turn in to the nationalism. Thus he
becomes a most suitable person to head the drafting committee. Therefore the
constitution has to focus on social reform and renascence. Dr. Ambedkar was
needed despite lost the election, but entered the CA from Bengal and later from
Bombay.
The Constituent Assembly, thus was constituted, agreed that it had two
objectives first was to attain independence and freedom. The second was social
revolution i.e. freedom from all sorts of oppressions. S. Radhakrishnan proposed
3rd objective socio-economic revolution a transition from primitive rural economy
to scientific and planned agriculture and industry. Rural handicrafts and peasant
economy based economic planning village based election to State legislature and
Parliament were discussed but the C.A members agreed upon only modern industry
based economy and British type of party based elections parliamentary system.
All members had agreed that India would become one political nation with one
constitution and flag.
On the whole social justice agenda was accepted by the members. After
constituting CA Jawaharlal Nehru moved Objectives Resolution setting nation’s
agenda for social justice. He stated that primarily objective was - social justice to
emancipate the Depressed Classes socially, economically and politically. Root
cause of this was in Objectives Resolution it was product of 1940s turn in people’s

The Making of Indian Constitution
The Constitution of India was prepared and adopted by the Constituent
Assembly. This was the culmination of the long struggle of the Indian people for
freedom from British colonial rule. As the British government decided to give
freedom to the people of India, a new Constitution was needed through which the
people of India could rule themselves and set long term objectives for themselves.
For this purpose, Constituent Assembly was formed in 1946, following the
election to the provincial assemblies. The Constituent Assembly members were
elected indirectly by the members of the provincial assemblies. The Cabinet Mission
appointed in 1946 allotted seats to each
Province and each Princely State or group of
States. Accordingly, Provinces or areas under
direct British rule elected 292 members and
all Princely States together elected 93
members. The plan also guaranteed that the
seats in each Province had members from
the major communities in India :
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and others, in
proportion to their respective
populations. The Council also
ensured that 26 members from
Scheduled Castes are represented in the
Assembly. While elections were held in

consultation. In all it had only nine women
members. The Indian National Congress was the single largest party with 69% of
all seats followed by the Muslim League which had most of the seats reserved for
Muslims. In the beginning, it had members from all parts of British India and after
14 August 1947, as the country was partitioned between India and Pakistan, the
members from Pakistan formed a separate Constituent Assembly for Pakistan.
As you can see, the Constituent Assembly (CA) was not elected through
universal adult franchise, but indirectly and as such did not represent all sections
of Indian society. Only about 10% of the population could vote in the provincial
elections then. In fact, the members from the princely states were not elected at
all and were decided through consultation with the concerned princely states. Such
a decision was taken keeping in view the special situation that had arisen due to
intense political activity on the eve of freedom and mounting tensions among the

Federalism

“Two principal forms of the Constitution are known to history - one is called
Unitary and the other Federal. The two essential characteristics of a Unitary
Constitution are: (1) the supremacy of the Central Polity [the word polity means
system of government or political organisation ] and (2) the absence of subsidiary
Sovereign polities. Contrariwise, a Federal Constitution is marked: (1) by the
existence of a Central polity and subsidiary polities side by side, and (2) by each
being sovereign in the field assigned to it. In other words, Federation means the
establishment of a Dual Polity [dual system of government central and state]. The
Draft Constitution is, Federal Constitution in as much as it establishes what may
be called a Dual Polity. This Dual Polity under the proposed Constitution will
consist of the Union at the Centre and the States at the periphery each endowed
with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively
by the Constitution.
“This dual polity resembles the American Constitution. The American polity
is also a dual polity, one of it is known as the Federal Government and the other
States which correspond respectively to the Union Government and the State
Governments of the Draft Constitution. Under the American Constitution the
Federal Government is not a mere league of the States nor are the States

“There is another special feature of the proposed Indian Federation which
distinguishes it from other federations. A Federation being a dual polity based
on divided authority with separate legislative, executive and judicial powers for
each of the two polities is bound to produce diversity in laws, in administration
and in judicial protection. Up to a certain point this diversity does not matter. It
may be welcomed as being an attempt to accommodate the powers of
Government to local needs and local circumstances. But this very diversity when
it goes beyond a certain point is capable of producing chaos and has produced
chaos in many federal States. One has only to imagine twenty different laws - if
we have twenty States in the Union - of marriage, of divorce, of inheritance of
property, family relations, contracts, torts, crimes, weights and measures, of
bills and cheques, banking and commerce, of procedures for obtaining justice
and in the standards and methods of administration. Such a state of affairs not
only weakens the State but becomes intolerant to the citizen who moves from
State to State only to find that what is lawful in one State is not lawful in another.
The Draft Constitution has sought to forge means and methods whereby India
will have Federation and at the same time will have uniformity in all basic matters
which are essential to maintain the unity of the country. The means adopted by
the Draft Constitution are three

“A dual judiciary, a duality of legal codes and a duality of civil services, as I

In the U. S. A. the Federal Judiciary and the State Judiciary are separate and

Dual Judiciary at all. The High Courts and the Supreme Court form one single
integrated Judiciary having jurisdiction and providing remedies in all cases arising
under the Constitutional law, the civil law or the criminal law. This is done to
eliminate all diversity in all remedial procedures. Canada is the only country which
furnishes a close parallel. The Australian system is only an approximation.

“The dual polity which is inherent in a federal system as I said is followed in
all federations by a dual service. In all Federations there is a Federal Civil Service
and a State Civil Service. The Indian Federation though a Dual Polity will have a
Dual Service but with one exception. It is recognised that in every country there
are certain posts in its administrative set up which might be called strategic
from the point of view of maintaining the standard of administration. It may not
be easy to spot such posts in a large and complicated machinery of administration.
But there can be no doubt that the standard of administration depends upon
the calibre of the Civil Servants who are appointed to these strategic posts.
Fortunately for us we have inherited from the past system of administration
which is common to the whole of the country and we know what these strategic
posts are. The Constitution provides that without depriving the States of their
right to form their own Civil Services there shall be an All India service recruited
on an All- India basis with common qualifications, with uniform scale of pay and
the members of which alone could be appointed to these strategic posts
throughout the Union.” [Ambedkar is referring here to the creation of the Public
Service Commission (IAS, IPS ) through which most important officials are
recruited both for the State and the Central Government.]

relation to clause 6 regarding ‘untouchability’ where it is said that-

T,

“Untouchability in any form is abolished and the imposition of any disability
only on that account shall be an offence.”
I do not understand how you can abolish untouchability without abolishing
the very caste system. Untouchability is nothing but the symptom of the disease,
namely, the caste system... Unless we can do away with the caste system
altogether there is no use tinkering with the problem of untouchability
superficially.
S. C. Banerjee: Mr. President, the word ‘untouchability’ actually requires
clarification. We have been accustomed to this word for the last 25 years, still
there is a lot of confusion as to what it connotes. Sometimes it means merely
taking a glass of water and sometimes it has been used in the sense of admission
of ‘Harijans’ into temples, sometimes it meant inter-caste dinner, sometimes
inter-caste marriage. Mahatma Gandhi who is the main exponent of
‘untouchability’, has used it in various ways and on different occasions with
different meanings. So when we are going to use the word ‘untouchability’, we

implication of this word?

A

I think we should make no distinction between untouchability and caste
distinction, because as Mr. Thakur has said, untouchability is merely a symptom,
the root cause is caste distinction and unless and until the root cause, that is
caste distinction is removed, untouchability in some form or other is bound to
exist and when we are going to have an independent India, we should expect
everyone to be enjoying equal social conditions.

The makers of Indian Constitution confronted the fact that Indian society was
ridden with inequality, injustice and deprivation and was a victim of colonial policies
which had exploited its economy. Thus, the Constitution had to facilitate social
change and development. Jawaharlal Nehru said that the Constituent Assembly
represents “the nation on a move throwing away the shell of its past political and
possibly social structure and fashioning for itself a new garment in its own making”.
The Constitution thus has many provisions facilitating social change. You have
read about abolition of Untouchability. The best example of this is the provision for
reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Constitution. The
makers of the Constitution believed that the mere granting of the right to equality
was not enough to overcome age-old injustices suffered by these groups or to give
real meaning to their right to vote. Special constitutional measures were required to
advance their interests. Therefore, the constitution makers provided a number of
special measures to protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
such as the reservation of seats in legislatures. The Constitution also made it possible
for the government to reserve public sector jobs for these groups.
The Constitution also has in it the “Directive Principles of State Policy” which
sets out the main social systems before the government. One important aspect of
the social engineering is the problem of the right of minorities. The sad experience
of suppression of Jewish minority in Nazi Germany weighed in the minds of the
Constitution makers. They decided to give special protection to the minority
community so that they don’t feel marginalised by the majority. One such right is
the right of religious minorities to run their own educational institutions. Such
institutions may even receive government funds.

The Constitution Today

The Constitutional makers were aware
that laws will have to be amended from time
to time. Thus, it laid down the provisions
for amending the laws and the articles in
the Constitution as well. Often laws can be
made with approval of more than half the
members in legislative houses. However,
amending the articles in the Constitution
can be initiated only by the Parliament. It
also needs the approval of 2/3rd members
in both the houses of parliament - Rajya
Sabha and Lok Sabha. And some articles may
be amended only with acceptance (or

President of the country also approves the new amendment bill like other laws.
Some major changes in the Constitution were made during 1970s. The first
among them is inclusion of two words into the Preamble of the Constitution
“Secular” and “Socialist”. Many words in the preamble like “Equality”, “Liberty”,
“Justice” etc emphasised the values of secularism and socialism and hence, these
words were added. The second major event in the life of Indian Constitution has
been a Supreme Court judgement popularly known as Keshavanada Bharati case. It
was held that even Parliament does not have the power to alter or destroy the basic
features of the Constitution. The ideas covered in the Preamble carry the basic
objectives of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has outlined the essential features
in series of judgement. Some of the elements of the basic structure are : The

Election System in India

In a vast country like India which has an enormous population, it may be difficult
for all the people to gather and take decisions. So, the
need for elections arise. India is the largest democratic
country in the world. Since independence, a strong basis
for democratic values was laid, by the elections.
The Election Commission of India conducts
elections in our country. It frames a Code of Conduct to
the political parties. It declares the results of the elections
and submits to the central or state governments. By this,

It is very difficult to conduct elections in India because of a huge population.
During the British rule, only 14% of the population had right to vote in the elections.
At the time of first General Elections in 1952, there were 17.32 crore voters. At
present, the number of voters is above 67 crores. For such a country, the Election
Commission conducts elections with the help of about 45 lakh staff.
The Central Election Commission
has no separate staff to conduct the
elections. As per the article 324(6) of
the Constitution, with the permission
of the President of India and the
Governors of the states, it utilises the
services of central and state
government employees. During such
times, the Election Commission has a
complete control over the government
department. Without the prior
permission of the Central Election
Commission, no major decisions can
be taken.

India is the second most populous country in the world. It is a huge task to
conduct elections in India. Every political party promises to give good governance,
socio - economic equality, and the eradication of poverty. But few corrupted
politicians, those who have criminal background adopt illegal practices to manage
the voters. Their practices lead some to make fun of the election process.
Even though there are some problems in the democratic process, many
examples of sincere and dedicated politicians made our democracy proud.

In the 15th chapter, we read about how the Constitution of India was made. The
Constitution sought to fulfill multiple goals simultaneously, including making
democracy work, unification and creation of a single political community and
bringing about massive social and economic changes. The setting of national goals
and putting in place institutional mechanisms to achieve them within a relatively
short span of time was undoubtedly a great achievement for a people who had been
ruled by foreign power for more than two centuries.

The early years after independence are arguably the defining period in India’s
post-independent history. The main challenge before the leadership was the need
to maintain unity and integrity, bring about a social and economic transformation
and to ensure the successful working of the democratic system. These challenges
are interrelated and great care had to be taken to ensure that the system did not get
imbalanced. For instance, developmental goals, unity and integrity should not come

One Party Dominance in Political System

SC
ER
T,

TE

In Independent India’s first three general elections in 1952, 1957 and 1962,
the Indian National Congress won reducing other participants to almost nothing.
Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India. None of the other parties
individually got more than 11% of the votes polled. The Congress consistently
won over 70% of the seats by obtaining about 45% of the total votes cast. No other
party was anyway near the Congress.
The Congress party formed the government in many of the states as well. This
inaugurated what some observers called the Congress System. This period is
identified specifically by the nature of the relationship between the almost always
ruling Congress party and the other parties. However, the Congress always had
smaller groups within it. Though these groups originated on the basis of personal
competition between leaders, they shared in the overall goals of the party but differed
on some policy issues.
The groups took different positions on various issues depending on the interests
of the members. This made the Congress appear as if it was a party representing
diverse interests and positions. At times, these groups also tied up with other
political parties to pressurise the leadership. This also acted as an inbuilt corrective
mechanism within the ruling party. Political competition in the one-party dominant
system therefore took place within the Congress and the opposition parties only
posed a latent and not a real threat.

It was therefore not an undemocratic situation marked by the absence of other
political parties. It was that other parties contested but were not able to win enough
seats to challenge the Congress. However other political parties gradually built
themselves and within a couple of decades became strong contenders for power.
This period, to a large extent helped nurture democracy in its early years allowing
the establishment of a multi-party system based on free and open competition.
It was the strength of the Constitutional framework and the democratic
foundations laid by the freedom movement which enabled Indian politics to develop
a multiparty democracy. Ruling parties have often acted in a partisan manner to
silence the opposition and prevent multiparty democracy from striking roots.

Demand for State Reorganisation
Among the first challenges that the new nation faced was the demand for
reorganisation of states on the basis of language. During the British period, the
country was divided into Presidencies (Calcutta, Madras and Bombay) and a number
of very large states like Central Provinces and Berar. A large part of the country

was under princely states. In each of these,
people speaking many different languages were
living together. For example, Madras Presidency
had in it people speaking Tamil, Malayalam,
Kannada, Telugu, Gondi and Oriya languages. All
the people speaking a language and living in
contiguous areas demanded to be organised
under one state. These included the campaign
for Samyukta Karnataka (uniting Kannada
speakers spread across Madras, Mysore,
Bombay and Hyderabad), Samyukta Maharashtra,
the Mahagujarat movement, the merger of
Travancore and Cochin princely states and the
state of Punjab for Sikhs. Would agreeing to
these demands help to build the unity of the
country or would it lead to the breaking of the

The partition of the country on the basis

language reorganisation would lead to break
down of the country. Hence, even though the
Congress itself was organised on the
linguistic lines and had promised to
restructure the country on those lines, it
developed cold feet when independence
came.
The most vigorous of all the movements
was that of the Telugu speakers which called
upon the Congress to implement the old
resolutions in favour of linguistic states. The

continued even after independence. The methods used included petitions,
representations, street marches and fasts. Given the Congress opposition to this
demand, the party did badly in the Telugu speaking areas in the first elections. The
seats went to parties who supported the linguistic movement.

Jawaharlal Nehru was not opposed to linguistic states; he only believed that
this was not the right time for it. It was also the consensual position among the
leaders of the day. They believed that India was in the process of consolidating
itself and there should be no distraction.

state began a hunger strike. In 15th December 1952, he died after 58 days of fasting.
Potti Sriramulu’s death was a turning point. Consequently, the states of Andhra
State and Tamil Nadu were created. In August 1953, the States Reorganisation
Commission (SRC) was appointed, with Fazl Ali, K. M. Panikkar and Hridaynath
Kunzru as members, to address the issue of formation of states on the basis of the
linguistic principle. On the basis of its report in 1956, the States Reorganisation

Social and Economic Change
The Constituent Assembly had called for social, economic and political justice
and equality of status and opportunity, it put social and economic change at the top
of the agenda of modern India. The Planning Commission was set up after the
inauguration of the new Constitution. For Nehru, planning was not only about good
economics but good politics as well. He hoped that planned development would
dissolve the divisions of caste and religion, community and region as well as other
disruptive and disintegrative tendencies and help India to emerge as a strong and
modern nation.
The First Five Year Plan focussed on agriculture and stressed on the need for
increasing food production, development of transport and communications and the
provision of social services. It also stressed the need to industrialise India as quickly
as possible. Given that food was a basic requirement, there was a consensus on
increasing food production but there was no agreement on how this should be
achieved. The two main questions that divided political opinion were: What place

agriculture should have in the larger
development strategy? How should
resources be allocated between industry
and agriculture?
For Nehru, agricultural transformation
was not simply an economic issue, but a
political, social and economic
transformation of the rural sector. The
strategy favoured by Nehru and finally adopted included three components: land
reforms, agricultural cooperatives and local self-government. Three types of land
reforms were contemplated: abolition of Zamindari system, tenancy reform and
land ceilings. The primary aim of all these was to ensure that the land went to the
hands of the actual tiller and this was to be an incentive for them to produce more.
Cooperatives were to bring economies of scale and also provide valuable inputs
like seeds, manure, fertilisers and so on. Local self-government would ensure that
the land reforms were carried out and the cooperatives run according to the collective

Land reforms were however implemented in a half hearted manner across India.
While Zamindari system was abolished, redistribution of land to the landless did
not take place. The rich and powerful in the rural areas continued to control most
of the land. The dalits continued to be landless but benefitted from the abolition of
forced labour and abolition of untouchability.
The First Five Year Plan focussed on improving agriculture by building large
dams to irrigate and produce electricity. Dams benefitted both the agriculture and
the industrial sector. Though there was an increase in agricultural production, it
was still not sufficient to meet the needs of the population.
The planners felt that for the country to develop, it was essential to develop
industries so that more people can shift to towns to work in factories and in the

With Nehru’s death in 1964, critics raised doubts as to
whether democracy itself would survive, or would it lose its
democratic ethos like other countries? The Congress
however managed a successful transition by choosing Lal
Bahadur Shastri as its leader in the government. Shastri was
immediately put to test with a series of issues which
challenged the fundamental values and goals of the Indian
nation. These included the Anti-Hindi agitation led by the
DMK in the South, which threatened the goals of unity and
integrity, the shortage of food which came in the way of social
and economic transformation, and a war with Pakistan in
1965. Indira Gandhi succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister
after his untimely death in 1966.

When the Official Languages Act was passed in 1963, the DMK believed it

campaign protesting the imposition of Hindi. These included strikes, dharnas, hartals
and burning of effigies, Hindi books as well pages of the Constitution. Hindi

signboards were also blackened in many places. There were pitched battles between
the police and the agitators. The Central government had to soon take note of these
protests. The Congress itself was divided between pro-Hindi and anti-Hindi camps.
Some felt that the unity of the country was at stake.
Finally, when things seemed to be going out of hand, Shastri, though he supported
the pro-Hindi stand, made a series of concessions to assuage the feelings of the
anti-Hindi camp. These included among others, the right of each state to have a
language of its own, which could be the regional language or English,
communications could be in regional languages with English translations, English
would continue to be the communication language between the centre and the states
and that the civil service exams would be conducted in English rather than Hindi
alone.

Rise of Regional parties and Regional movements

SC
ER
T,

The 1967 election was a landmark election in the history of India. It showed that
elections had come to be taken very seriously and had a life of their own. By this
time, there were gainers and losers from the economic development process and
this changed the pattern of political competition. It was not surprising that the
Congress party suffered its worst defeat till then. It was returned with the lowest
majority it had since independence (284 seats). It was defeated in assemblies like
Bihar, U.P., Rajasthan, Punjab, West Bengal, Orissa, Madras and Kerala. This was the
first big transition in India. The party which had ruled continually for nearly 30 years
was now being challenged. The defeated party did not try to cling to power but allowed
the victors to form the government. This showed that democracy had taken roots in
India and the country was moving towards a competitive multi-party system.
The prominent losses for the Congress included Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In
Tamil Nadu, the DMK won by a huge margin. It also showed that strongly organised
regional movements could challenge the dominant party. The DMK had strong
links with the film industry and was able to galvanise fans organisations of the
popular hero, M G Ramachandran popularly called MGR across the state.
The Congress also lost in the neighbouring state, Kerala, as also in West Bengal
and Odisha. These defeats and challenges also weakened the Congress internally.

In many states in the north, where it had won narrow victories, its members defected
to opposition parties. Consequently, the Congress governments fell and they were
replaced by Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD) governments. These were basically a
coalition of legislators against the Congress - made up Jan Sangh, Socialists,
Swatantra Party, and Congress defectors, besides local parties.

AN

The new governments are an important marker in India’s political history because
it was in a way the first democratic upsurge. It was for the first time that the
intermediate castes; the groups who had first benefitted from the land reforms and
acquired some degree of economic standing gained political power. These castes
included the Jats in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, Kurmis and Koeris in Bihar, Lodhs
in MP as well as the Yadavs in all these states; the Reddys and Kammas in Andhra
Pradesh, the Vokkaligas in Karnataka and the Vellalas in Tamil Nadu. They were the
dominant castes in their respective states and also had a significant numerical
presence. The DMK itself is the best example of the coming to age of the other
dominant (backward) castes.

AL

Many of these SVD governments were however short-lived. Their life was
marked by defections and corruption. Power seemed to be the only thing that united
them. These governments had nothing to showcase. However, the problem is that
even today, the regional or state parties are evaluated from this standpoint.

TE

This period saw a renewal of a regional sentiment in different parts of the
country. In Andhra Pradesh, there was demand for the separation of Telangana. The
movement was spearheaded by the students of Osmania University, whose main
grouse was that the benefits of development were reaching only few regions of the
state.

In Assam, a new state called Meghalaya was
created in December 1969 out of the tribal districts
of Khasi, Jaintia and Garo hills. Punjab, despite being
formed in 1966, did not have a capital of its own.
During the period 1968-69, there were a series of
demonstrations asking for Chandigarh which served
as the common capital of Haryana and Punjab to be
given to them. In Maharashtra, there was a curious
demand of Bombay for Maharashtrians only. This was
led by the Shiv Sena. The main target of this party was
the South Indians who the party believed were
cornering all the employment in the city.

At the same time, old demands also continued. The Kashmir and the Nagaland
demands also came up during this period. Sheikh Abdullah came back to the state
after he was freed from house arrest. Similarly in Nagaland, a new younger
leadership came up to take the struggle forward.

This was also a period of communal tension. There were riots in different
parts of the country including Ranchi (Bihar), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Jalgaon
(Maharashtra) as well as Aligarh (Uttar Pradesh). These were difficult times. A
political transition has just happened and a new leadership was taking its place. The
new leadership was yet to be equipped to handle the multitude of pressures that
were arising as a result of the growing political awareness and articulation of
demands.

Indira Gandhi took up the challenge both from within her party as well those
outside by taking a sharp left turn post the 1967 elections. She attempted to create
a new social base of her own and for her party by identifying with the poor and
down trodden. This move was a double edged weapon. Old promises of social and
economic development were yet to be fulfilled and this was seen to be the major
reason for the defeat of Congress party in 1967. Yet, the Congress under Indira
Gandhi was making new promises. Less than a decade later, the lack of fulfilment
of rising mass expectations created frustration and disheartenment and culminated
with the imposition of Emergency.

In the early 1970s, trouble was brewing in East Pakistan (what is now
Bangladesh) as a movement for the assertion of Bengali identity and protest against
what was seen as a step-motherly treatment by West Pakistan. In the general
elections, the party led by Mujibur Rahaman won but he was arrested and taken to
West Pakistan and a period of military repression of East Pakistan began. Lakhs of
refugees streamed to India which had to feed and house them. Meanwhile, a
liberation movement started in Bangladesh and India was asked to assist in it. In
1971, a war broke out between India and Pakistan and India decisively intervened
to ensure the liberation of Bangladesh and its establishment as an independent
country. India was able to do this not only because it had built up its military
strength but also because it skillfully used its non-aligned position between the
two super powers to ensure that they did not intervene in the war.

SC

Indira Gandhi charted a new path for the Congress and herself by introducing
new policies and programmes. This policy also helped her get control over the
party organisation.
Until 1971, the elections to the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly were
held simultaneously in most States. Indira Gandhi broke this pattern, by calling for
early elections in 1971 rather than 1972. The Congress went to elections using
popular slogan “Garibi Hatao”. It also promised radical restructuring of the
system to benefit the poor and marginalised. The Congress won with a record margin
and this raised the popularity of Indira Gandhi. The opposition was decimated, her
critics were silenced and she became the darling of the masses. Soon after, there
was the war with Pakistan and India’s victory further raised the popularity of Indira
Gandhi. In the legislative assembly elections held subsequently in 1972, the
Congress did well and was riding on the popularity wave of Indira Gandhi. She now
had control over both the party as well as the parliament.
Among the important legislations that were passed during this period apparently
to achieve the goal of social and economic transformation were the nationalisation

of many private banks and
abolishing of princely pensions.
Both these legislations were
challenged in the Courts and this,
in a way, made the Court appear
as if it was coming in the way of
the political goals.
The judiciary, however, had
other ideas regarding the policies
and programmes. The Supreme
Court was afraid that the

which and this was unbalancing the
existing relations between different institutional structures. In 1973, the Court
came up with the landmark decision on the Basic Structure of the Constitution,
which put a check on the governmental power to amend the Constitution.
Events beyond her control put Indira Gandhi in a spot and made it difficult for
her to fulfil all the promises. Her term coincided with a rather grave social and
economic conditions. The 1973, Arab-Israeli war raised the oil prices to an all
time high and put huge pressure on the government. Inflation and the rise in prices
of essential items, scarcity of food and unemployment began to have an effect.
There was a general unhappiness among large sections of the population. This
gave the Opposition a chance to get its act together. They began to tap into this
discontent in different parts of the country. The opposition, united under Jaya
Prakash Narayan, ran a series of campaigns in different parts of the country against
the Congress and especially against Indira Gandhi. This was the JP movement and
it was very prominent in Bihar and Gujarat.

Emergency

The government reacted harshly by coming up with a series of laws which
violated civil rights in the name of maintaining order. The opposition also criticised
the P.M. for personalising the government. Meanwhile, due to a decision of
Allahabad High court, Indira Gandhi was unseated from Lok Sabha for violating
some election provisions during the 1971 elections. However, she got a stay from
the Supreme Court.
A few days later, with the JP movement gaining more strength, the government
imposed Emergency and justified it as necessary to preserve order, save
democracy, protect the social and economic transformation and preserve national
integrity.

With this, democracy was put on hold. The government began a series of
repressive measures, claiming that this was necessary to bring order in the country.
Many of the fundamental rights were suspended. There were also instances of
arbitrary detention, torture and other violations of civil liberties. While people
welcomed control over price rise and the campaign against black marketing and
bonded labour, many programmes undertaken by the emergency government such
as demolition of slums and forced sterilisation in the name of population control
became very unpopular. However, in the absence of civic freedom, people could
not express their discontent and the government, therefore, could not take corrective
measures.
The major highlight of this period was the 42nd Constitutional Amendment
which brought about a series of changes. It had the following aims: a) Excluding
the courts from election disputes; b) Strengthening the central government vis-àvis the state governments; c) Providing maximum protection from judicial
challenges to social and economic transformation legislation; d) Making the
judiciary subservient to parliament. While the supposed aim of the Amendment
was to protect social and economic development from judiciary, strengthen national
unity and so on, in reality, it actually weakened the democratic fabric of this country.

Summing up

Though the first thirty years ended with the Emergency, if a balance sheet were
to be drawn, there would be more credits than debits.
The most important achievement of this period was the establishment of a
stable democracy. The gradual emergence of a competitive multi-party system,
with parties representing diverse interests was a real achievement if one were to
compare India with other countries that got independence around the same time.
India, unlike other countries, not only had regular, free and fair elections but also
had genuine change of governments and leaders as well. The Indian Constitution
not only guaranteed civil rights but also had an institutional architecture in place to
ensure its protection.
India also set up an impressive institutional framework with independent
institutions like the judiciary, Election Commission, Controller and Auditor General
and so on. Bureaucratic neutrality was also an important achievement. The
establishment of civilian control over the armed forces was another significant
achievement. In comparison to our neighbour, Pakistan, India stands far ahead in
the institutions of democracy.
India has been extremely successful in holding together and maintaining its
unity and integrity. India was seen a fit case for break up given its extreme diversities
and the fact, that it has not done so is a valuable lesson for many other countries.
In terms of economic goals, the setting up of the Planning Commission and
the aim of balanced regional development is noteworthy. There was a genuine

concern for the social and economically deprived sections of society. From a state
of dependency for food, India gradually became self-sufficient in food production.
It laid down the foundation for an enviable industrial base. However, balanced
regional development did not take place and some regions developed better than
others. Similarly, employment opportunities also did not increase as much as they
should have.
One of the greatest weaknesses was undoubtedly the low priority given to
primary education and public health. This was going to haunt India for a long time
to come. Other countries like China and Korea which also began a new innings
around the same time did much better on these two counts as compared to India.
While the more obnoxious effects of the caste system, like untouchability
were removed, there still remained a large amount of discrimination. Gender
discrimination continued.

The period between 1975 to 1985 was a testing time for Indian democracy. It
began with the state of Emergency in which basic democratic rights were denied
and ended with the historic electoral victory of the Congress led by Rajiv Gandhi.
Though it began and ended with the rule of the Congress party, it saw the emergence
of viable alternatives to the Congress at both the Centre and in the States. This
effectively prevented India from sliding into a ‘single party democracy’ as it
happened in many countries. The emergence of competitive alternatives ensured
that Indian voters could always exercise a reasonable choice. This also allowed
many different political viewpoints and sectional interests to become active in
state level as well as national politics. Political viewpoints of Socialists, Hindu
nationalists, Communists, as well as sectional interests like those of farmers, dalits,
backward castes, and regions among others now came to the fore and asserted
their claims. At the same time, a

1977 Elections and the End of Emergency
When elections were announced in January 1977, it took everyone by surprise.
No one had expected elections to be held. Indira Gandhi also released all political
prisoners, removed censorship as well as all other regulations in place which
restricted freedom of movement, campaigns and meetings. The major opposition
parties decided to come together to challenge the Congress. The Congress (O),
Swatantra Party, Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the Bharatiya Lok Dal and the Socialist party
decided to merge together and form the Janata (peoples) Party. Some important
Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram quit the party to join the anti-Congress front.
The other major opposition parties like the DMK, the SAD and the CPI (M) chose
to maintain their separate identities but supported the Janata Party in a common
front against the Congress. Senior leaders like Jayaprakash Narayan and Acharya
JB Kriplani played an important role in bringing together all the anti-Congress and
anti-Emergency parties to fight the elections. It should be noted that some of these
parties had diametrically opposite viewpoints on social and political issues.

The Janata Party had come to power promising a
restoration of democracy and freedom from authoritarian
rule. However, the disunity among the partners had a serious
effect on the governance and its rule is most often
remembered for internal squabbles and defections. The
factional struggle in the party soon culminated in the fall of
the government within three years leading to fresh elections
in 1980.
The Congress returned to power in 1980. The Congress
immediately paid back the Janata in the same coin by
dismissing the Janata and non-Congress governments in nine
States. The Congress was victorious in all the States except

In combined Andhra Pradesh, the frequent

leadership and the imposition of leaders from

This was perceived as an insult to the pride of the

actor, chose to take up this cause. He began the
Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on his 60th birthday in
1982. He said that the TDP stood for the honour
and self respect of the Telugu speaking people

helped the TDP to sweep the 1982 elections. However, he was surreptitiously
dismissed by the Governor in 1984 when he was away in the United States for a
surgery. The Governor appointed N Bhaskar Rao, who had defected from the TDP

Assam (Assom) Movement

A similar but much stronger demand for autonomy was also taking place in
Assom. In Assom, besides Assamese, Bengali was also a major spoken language.
From British times’, Bengalis occupied the lower and middle rungs of the
administration in the State. The Assamese speaking people felt that the Bengali
officialdom did not treat them as equals but as second-class citizens. To make
matters worse, there was a lot of migration from across the border from Bangladesh.
Whenever there was any political instability or natural calamity in the neighbouring
country, thousands of people moved into the state creating huge discomfort for

the locals. The local people felt that they would lose their cultural roots and soon
be outnumbered by the ‘outsiders’.
In the late 1970s, this general feeling of unhappiness was transformed into a
social movement. The All Assam Students Union (AASU) was at the forefront of
the agitation. This organisation spread across the State and was especially popular
among the youth. It led a number of strikes, agitations and marches directed against
the central government to make its demands clear - mainly to remove the so-called
‘outsiders’.
Besides culture and demographics, there was also an economic dimension to
this issue. Trade and other establishments were in the hands of non-Assamese
communities. The major resources of the state, including tea and oil, did not benefit
the locals. The tea industry was mainly based in Kolkata and the oil industry had
very few locals involved despite being in the hands of the public-sector. Furthermore,
the oil was being moved out of the state and refined elsewhere. All in all, the
dominant thrust of the movement was that Assam was being treated as an “internal
colony” and this had to stop. The main demands were that the local people should
be given greater preference in employment, the “outsiders” should be removed and
the resources should be used for the benefit of the locals.
These demands, however, created a communal polarisation as most of the
outsiders who came from the neighbouring country were Muslims. To make matters
worse, the movement soon began to take anti-Bengali, anti-Left (as West Bengal
was being ruled by the Left Front), anti-non-Assamese and gradually even an antiIndian stand. The central government was soon forced to take note of the movement
as violence and disruption increased. Talks between the agitationists and the central
government went on for three years before they came to an agreement. An agreement
was signed by the Central Govt and the AASU at the initiative of the then Prime
Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1984. To restore normalcy, in an unusually magnanimous
move, the Congress government in the State stepped down and allowed elections
even before the end of its term. When elections were held, the Assam Gana Parishad
(AGP - an offshoot of AASU) came to power.
This political transition, however, did not resolve the long term problems which
gave rise to the movement. The border with Bangladesh could not be sealed due to
both diplomatic as well as geographic reasons (given the waterways and hills, it is
not possible to erect fences everywhere). It was also not possible to really
differentiate between old Bengali settlers and fresh immigrants or send the
immigrants back. At the same time, too much emphasis on ethnic identities had a
negative impact on other communities of Assom like the Bodos, Khasis, Mizos
and Karbis. Many of them too demanded autonomous status. They began to assert
themselves and wanted to drive out people of other communities from their areas.
This has led to violent attempts of ‘ethnic cleansing’ or forcible eviction of minority
tribal communities by even outright mass killing in many parts of Assom. Often, in

order to counter violent activities of one community, the governments instigated
or armed another community and in this way, kept alive the tensions instead of
solving them.
The Central Government also stepped up the deployment of armed forces in
these areas to reduce tension and bring peace. Three factors influenced the use of
armed forces in the North Eastern region: firstly, the fact that it was a sensitive
border area adjacent to China, Burma (now Myanmar) and Bangladesh; secondly,
the rebel groups often demanded separation from India and procured arms and help
from outside forces; and thirdly, the fact that these rebel groups indulged in largescale ethnic violence against minority communities. As the Indian armed forces
entered this difficult terrain, it led to suspension of civil liberties and freedom and
also to giving abnormal powers to the army. The government thought that this was
the only way to bring about peace in the area.
Thus, what started as a problem between Bengalis and Assamese developed
into a complex inter-community conflict in a very sensitive area. The problem of
ethnic identities and ethnic assertion, therefore, requires a broad minded approach
rather than narrow minded and quick solutions.

The Punjab Agitation

At the other end of India, another movement for autonomy was taking shape in
the State of Punjab. Here too, the difference in language and religion of the dominant
population became a point of mobilisation. Here also the grouse was that the
contribution of the State was being ignored. They also believed that the State had
received an unfair bargain when it was created. It laid claims to the new capital city
of Chandigarh which remained a union territory directly administered by the Centre.
Punjab also claimed more water from Bhakra Nangal dam and greater recruitment
of Sikhs in the army.
The Akali Dal had passed a set of resolutions in 1978 during the Janata Party
rule in the centre, calling upon the central government to implement them. Its

states and ensure greater decentralisation of powers. The resolution said,

With the increasing electoral competition between the SAD and the Congress,
things took a turn for the worse. The dismissal of the Akali government and the
return of the Congress in 1980 only added to already surcharged atmosphere and
the feeling that the Sikhs were being discriminated against. A series of untoward
incidents followed, increasing the alienation/ distance between the Sikhs and the
central government. Bhindranwale, the leader of the group of militant Sikhs, began
to preach separatism and also demanded the formation of a Sikh State- Khalistan.
This was a period of intense turmoil in the State. The militants tried to impose an
orthodox life code on all Sikhs and even non-sikhs of Punjab. There was also a
communal colour to the conflict. People belonging to non-Sikh communities were
subjected to communal attacks. All this finally culminated in the occupation of the
Golden Temple by the Sikh separatist groups and the army had to intervene to vacate

the premises. This was seen as an act of desecration of the holiest shrine of the
Sikhs and increased their alienation.
A fallout of all this was the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in
1984. This was followed by riots, especially in Delhi, in which thousands of Sikhs
were attacked, murdered and their properties destroyed. The administration seemed
to do little to stop the violence.
After Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister, he held talks with SAD and
entered into an agreement with Sant Langowal, the SAD president. Though fresh
elections were held in Punjab and SAD won them, peace was short lived as
Longowal was assassinated by the militants.
In April 1986, an assembly at the Akal Takht made a declaration for an
independent state of Khalistan. Several groups claiming to be fighters for an
independent state formed armed detachments and engaged in terrorist activities.
The government of India claimed that these groups were actively supported by the
government of Pakistan. This was a decade of violence and conflict in Punjab. The
period of insurgency saw clashes of the Sikh militants with the police, as well as
with other religious groups. Journalists, politicians, artists and activists who did
not conform to militant-approved behaviour were killed. There were indiscriminate
attacks designed to cause extensive civilian casualties: derailing trains, exploding
bombs in markets, restaurants and other civilian areas between Delhi and Punjab.
In 1991 alone, about a thousand people were killed. The militants were also engaged
in large scale kidnapping and extortion to raise funds for their work. All this
gradually alienated them from the masses of the Punjabi people including Sikhs.
Over a period of time, effective police action broke down the militancy and as
public sympathy declined rapidly, peace finally returned to Punjab by the end of
the 1990s.
However, the government used very harsh methods for the suppression of
militancy in Punjab, many of which were seen as violations of Constitutional rights

governments, especially, those run by opposition parties felt that it was an attempt
to bypass them and reduce their powers.
In the economic sphere too, Rajiv Gandhi attempted to chart a different course.
His government’s first budget in 1985 moved towards a more liberalised system
by removing some of the checks and controls that were in place.
Rajiv Gandhi was also convinced that India needed to adapt itself to the new
technologies emerging in the world, especially computer and telecommunication
technologies. He initiated what is called the ‘telecom revolution’ in India which

protested against this judgement saying that it went against Islamic law and that if
this was allowed then there may be further interference in the religious life of the
community. The leaders of women’s movement and those who stood for reform
within the Muslim society argued that it would help to reverse the gross injustice
being meted out to Muslim women who were divorced unilaterally by their husbands.
The government came under pressure of the orthodox sections and enacted a new
law in 1986 which let off Muslim husbands and permitted Muslim religious bodies
to pay maintenance to divorced women for a short period of 3 months. This was
widely seen as compromising before religious orthodoxy and ignoring the interests
of women of the community.
Around the same time, some sections of the Hindus had begun a campaign for
building a temple for Lord Rama in Ayodhya, in the place of the controversial
construction, Babri Masjid. They claimed that it was the birth place of Lord Rama
and it has been built by destroying the earlier temple. The custodians of Babri
Masjid denied this and claimed that this was a place of worship for Muslims. This
place had been under dispute for some time and the Court had ordered it be kept
closed except on one day in a year till the final decision was taken. In 1986, the
Court ordered that the mosque may be kept open on all days and allow Hindus to
perform worship on a daily basis. It was widely believed that this could happen
only because the central government approved of this decision. This opening up of
the temple helped those groups who wanted to convert the mosque into a temple to
mobilise a large number of people.
To many observers, it appeared that the established political parties were losing
popularity among the people. Large number of popular movements were emerging
over a number of issues under non-political leaderships. The large farmers producing
for market were fighting for better prices for agricultural products and greater
subsidy for inputs like diesel, fertilisers and electricity. Farmers of UP and Haryana
agitated under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Tikait, while farmers of
Maharashtra were fighting under the leadership of Sharad Joshi. In many States,
movements of adivasis and farmers against displacement by development projects
like dams and mines were also building up. The observers felt that this decline in
popularity led the national political parties to pander to religious feelings in both
Hindu and Muslim communities so as to retain their support in elections. However,
it weakened the secular fabric of Indian polity and made way for a rise of communal
politics in the following decade.
Around the same time, charges began to be levied against several leaders that
they had directly or indirectly received bribes from the Swedish manufacturers of
guns that were being supplied to the Indian army. Even though these charges could
never be proved clearly, a powerful campaign was led by some former ministers of
cabinet itself like V P Singh. The issue of corruption in administration and in
political circles became the main plank of the election campaign for non-congress

political forces in the next elections held in 1989. Once the non-congress parties,
irrespective of their differences amongst themselves got together, it became
difficult for the Congress to win. Though Congress returned with the highest number
of seats, it did not have enough seats to form a government on its own. The first
coalition government led by V P Singh’s Janata Dal was formed.

The Era of Coalition politics

The 1990s were years of very significant change in the
post Independence India. With the transformation to a
competitive multi-party system, it became near impossible
for any single party to win a majority of seats and form a
government of its own. Since 1989, all governments that had
formed at the national level have been either coalition or
minority governments. A number of national and regional
parties had come together to form governments at the centre.
This meant that the political ideologies and programmes of a
number of parties had to be accommodated and a common
agreement had to be arrived at. Thus, no party could pursue
Fig 18.7 : VP. Singh
its extreme agendas and had to tone down their approaches.
While this enabled the central government to become more sensitive to multiple
viewpoints in politics and policy matters, it also caused considerable instability.
Even small parties tried to gain undue advantage as the withdrawal of their support
could cause the fall of the government. Sometime this also caused ‘policy paralysis’
– as the coalition could not implement any policy which called for serious change
for fear of withdrawal of support by one or the other partners.

West Bengal government launched Operation Barga to record the names of the
sharecroppers (Bargadars who tilled the land belonging to landlords and paid a
large share of the produce as rent to them), who formed a major part of the agrarian
population in West Bengal and to secure their rights. Operation Barga depended
heavily on collective action by the sharecroppers and panchayati raj institutions,
thus avoiding bureaucratic delays and domination of the landowning classes.
Officials held camps in the villages in which the various stakeholders would meet
and discuss their issues. A list of claimants would be drawn up immediately after,
and publicly verified in the presence of the landholders, who could then record
their objections. Then, the names of the bargadars would be recorded on the spot,
and all legal documents would be issued and distributed immediately.
As a result of Operation Barga, the landlords were largely prevented from
forcibly throwing the bargadars off the land. In fact, the bargadar rights were made
hereditary and thus perpetual. Secondly, the State guaranteed that the bargadars
would receive a fair share of the crop (75 per cent if the bargadar provided the nonlabour inputs and 50 per cent if the landlord provides those inputs). In all,
approximately half of rural households in West Bengal have received land reform
benefits.

This shift in politics was accompanied by some other significant developments.
On one hand, India was forced to open up and ‘liberalise’ its economy by allowing
freer flow of foreign capital and goods into India; on the other hand, new social
groups asserted themselves politically for the first time, and finally religious
nationalism and communal political mobilisation became important features of
our political life. All this put the Indian society into great turmoil. We are still
coming to grips with these changes and adapting ourselves to them.

secularism are western ideas and are not sufficient and what is needed is to draw
upon ancient Indian culture. The BJP, however, opposes the idea of a religious
priesthood run theocratic state. The BJP has opened the debate on the nature of
secularism by asserting that a secular state does not give special treatment to
minorities, but common civil code is to be applicable to all.

This tendency was largely on the margins of Indian politics till the 1980s. For
example, in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections, they won only 2 seats. However, BJP
made great strides when it took up the Ayodhya issue – it decided to campaign for
the building of a temple at the site of the mosque claiming that it was the site of
birth of Lord Rama. In 1990, L K Advani, the leader of BJP led a “Rath Yatra”
from Somnath to Ayodhya in support of these demands. During the campaign, the
BJP tried to argue that the secular politics was trying to ignore the interests of the
Hindu majority while trying appease to the minority communities, especially the
Muslims. This campaign was accompanied by intense communal polarisation causing
a large number of communal conflicts and finally ended with the arrest of L K
Advani in Bihar. The BJP responded to this arrest by withdrawing support to V P
Singh government and forcing early elections.

During this election campaign, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by LTTE, a Tamil
separatist group of Sri Lanka, as a retaliation for his role in sending Indian army to
Sri Lanka. In the sympathy wave that followed, the Congress came back to power in
the Centre, but this time, BJP’s strength had gone up to 120 in the Lok Sabha. In
1992, a large crowd mobilised on behalf of the temple campaign gathered in
Ayodhya and destroyed the mosque. This event sparked off widespread protests
and communal riots in which many of people were killed.

Economic liberalisation
In 1991, when the V P Singh government fell, India was facing very serious
economic crises. Its reserve of foreign currency with which it repaid its loans and
paid for imports, had been virtually exhausted. This meant that India would have to
default in payments to foreign countries unless it urgently got some loan. In 1992,
when the new Congress government under P V Narasimha Rao was formed, it

negotiated with the International Monetary Fund for loans to tide
over the crises. The IMF laid down certain stringent conditions
(called ‘structural adjustment programme’), forcing India to
accept a policy of liberalisation. This meant
a. drastic reduction of government expenditure – including
cuts in subsidies to farmers, expenditure on public
services, health, etc.
b. reducing restrictions and taxes on import of foreign goods
c. reducing restrictions on foreign investments in India
d. opening of many sectors of the economy (like telephone,
Fig 18.8 :
banking, airlines, etc) to private investors (these were
P.V. Narasimha Rao
government monopolies earlier)
These measures brought in foreign goods and forced Indian business to compete
with global manufacturers. It also led to the setting up of industries and business by
foreign companies in India. However, it also meant a lot of hardship for the common
people as the government was forced to cut subsidies to the people and as many
factories closed down due to influx of cheap foreign goods. This also led to
privatisation of many public amenities like education, health, and transport and
people had to pay high prices to private service providers.
The twentieth century closed with an India which was drawn into the world
market, an India which seemed to have a thriving democracy in which voices of
different sections of the population were making themselves heard and in which,
divisive and communal political
mobilisation were threatening to
destroy social peace. It had stood the
test of time for over fifty years and
had built a relatively stable economy

challenges and in the process has strengthened itself. Indian democracy would be

many questions being asked of India’s democracy. Despite being a continuous
democracy, why hasn’t India been able to take care of the well being of a large

The impact of the Second World War was
different for different countries. The worst
affected were the European countries, especially
the USSR, Poland and Yugoslavia, which lost about
20% of its population. In economic terms too,
the USSR and other European countries lost
heavily with the destruction of cities, factories
and mines on a massive scale. About 1700 towns,
31,000 factories and over 70,000 villages of
USSR had been completely destroyed. In contrast
the USA suffered less as the war was not fought
on its territories. In fact, the Second World War Fig 19.1 : View of the city of Warsaw

caused by the Great Depression. Far from the
threats of the war, the industries and agriculture of USA actually prospered. This
ensured full employment and high productivity in US during the Second World
War. In March 1945, the US President, Harry Truman, said, ‘We have emerged
from this War, the most powerful nation in the world – the most powerful nation,
perhaps, in all history.’
Even as the war - devastated countries rebuilt their economics, the world saw
some new processes came into existence. Three of the most important processes
were the establishment of the United Nations, Cold War and Decolonisation. The
Second World War had been fought on the principles of peace, democracy and
freedom of nations in contrast to the Nazi ideas of dictatorship and Imperialism.
Thus, the first task was to establish a global organisation that would ensure peace
and development in all nations. This led to the formation of the United Nations
Organisation. Colonial powers like Britain and France could no longer justify their
old colonial policies. They also had been politically and economically weakened
vis a vis USA which was pressurising them to dismantle the old colonial system
which gave the old colonial powers exclusive access to the colonies. The USSR
was also emerging as a champion of anti colonial struggles which in many places
were led by Communist Parties inspired by the USSR. Under these conditions ,old
powers like Britain had no choice but to grant freedom to their old colonies. You

The principle Allied countries like Britain, France, USA, USSR and China
drafted a Charter for the formation of the UNO even as the war drew to an end. The
Charter not only emphasised the need to preserve peace and prevent wars, but also
the need to ensure human rights, democracy and eradication of poverty and hunger
for all people in the world. The UN thus started with a twin objective of ensuring
lasting peace and human development. At the same time, it recognised the autonomy
of states and promised not to interfere in any internal affairs of a country except in
cases mandated by serious human rights violation or threat to world peace.
At the time of its establishment, UN had membership of 51 countries and today
(2016 ) there are 193 countries. As countries liberated themselves from colonial
powers in the decade that followed, they joined UN. The UN works through six
different organs. Each of these organs has specific functions like maintaining peace
and security, improving education and health facilities, alleviating poverty, providing
justice in the context of international crimes and so on. Some bodies responsible
for these functions include International Court of Justice located in Hague; the
World Health Organisation located at Geneva, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation functioning from Paris, and United Nations
Children's Fund functioning from New York.
In electing the Secretary General, the main
officer of the UN, all nations participate and the post
is rotated across different continents. The General
Assembly is the main body where regular discussions
between nations take place. However, decisions
relating to war and peace are taken in the Security
Council and five nations have special status within
it. These are called permanent members of the
Security Council and they are: China, France, United
Kingdom; USSR (now Russia) and USA. Any decision
taken by the Council can be vetoed (made invalid or
rejected) by the intervention of even any one of these

themselves involved in many of the
conflicts used their veto power to block
any action by the UNO. Sometimes, they
have also used their power to force the UN
to bend to their dictates. However, the very
existence of a forum like UN has forced
the great powers to exercise moderation
and self-control. The special powers also
have given the great powers a special role
and responsibility in preserving world
peace.
While the UN has been doing

education, health, cultural exchange

The Two Camps and the Cold War (1945-1991)

SC

T,

Two major ideological and political camps emerged in the post war period –
the Communist block led by the USSR and the Democratic-Capitalist Block led by
the USA. On one hand, the USSR promoted the ideas of equality and state controlled
development and suppression of opposition to these principles. On the other hand,
USA promoted the ideas of multiparty democracy and private capitalist controlled
process of development. The USSR
had the entire Eastern Europe (Poland,
Hungary, and East Germany) under its
influence and many colonies which
were gaining freedom like China and
Vietnam were closely aligned to it. The
countries of Western Europe like
Britain, France, Spain were closely
allied with the USA. The two blocks
competed with each other for bringing
all the intermediate countries in their
blocks.

strange war was fought between
the two blocks. It was a war in
which the principal contenders
did not physically attack each
other or fight each other directly
and hence, there was no ‘hot’ war.

The Cold War was not just a propaganda war. It also saw real fighting and cost
around 20 million human lives. However, almost all of the people killed were
citizens of the Third World, viz., countries emerging from colonial domination
like Vietnam, Korea, Angola and Afghanistan. This division turned ethnically similar
people and geographically adjacent territories into enemies and it led to wasteful
wars between these countries.
Some main tactics used during the Cold War included proxy wars, military
alliances, and arms race.

Proxy War

Right from the outset, the two countries tried to bring the countries fighting
for freedom under their sphere of influence. This was done by supporting the two
opposing sides in each of those countries. US President Harry Truman authorised
support for the anti-communist forces in Turkey and Greece in 1947. The Belgian
colony in Africa-Congo, got independence in 1960. But it’s radical communist
leader, Patrice Lumumba, was killed in 1961, allegedly at the behest of US spy
agency called CIA. Angola became independent from Portugual in November 1975.
The Communists in Angola captured power with the help of USSR and Cuba. In
Latin America, Fidel Castro had led a revolution against an American backed
government and sought to build socialism on the lines of USSR. This inspired a
large number of people in Latin American countries to fight for a similar
transformation in their countries. One of their very popular leaders, Che Guevera,
was killed. Even elected governments led by socialists like the government of
Chile led by S Allende were toppled by US backed army generals.

The USSR also tried to expand its sphere of influence. To begin with, in 1950s,
it had to face the resistance of countries like Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
It sent its armies to dismiss unfriendly governments and install friendly governments
in those countries. After 1960s, China decided to disassociate itself from the USSR
and the latter tried unsuccessfully to pressurise China. In 1971, USSR invaded
Afghanistan to install a friendly government there. The US in turn provided armed
support to Afghan rebels who were also religious extremists. A prolonged civil
war ensued and as the USSR decided to withdraw from Afghanistan in 1985, the
country fell to religious extremists led by the Taliban which has now turned against
the USA. In all this chaos, we can see that the threat of warfare and destruction was
faced by the third world which was trying to emerge out of colonial control and the
wars were not fought so much by the Soviet or US troops but by the people of the
third world.

Both USA and USSR were in possession of nuclear weapons but knew very
well that neither would be a winner in a nuclear war. Yet, they formed military and
strategic alliances - the west formalised its alliances in an organisation known as
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949. To counter this, Communist
nations made similar alliances and signed the Warsaw Pact. In addition to this, U.S.
established regional military and strategic alliances like South East Asian Treaty

satellites and eventually led to
the US sending Neil Armstrong

Flash points

As the rival powers accumulated destructive weapons, the world was constantly
threatened by a nuclear holocaust. People of all countries lived in constant fear of
war. There were many moments when nuclear war between the two countries seemed
imminent, but got defused somehow through diplomacy. Some of these were the
incidents relating to the shooting down of U2 US spy plane over USSR, the discovery
of Soviet missile build up in Cuba and several times during the Korean and Middle
East wars.

Non Alignment Movement (NAM)
In 1950s, the world was getting increasingly militarised and divided into two
antagonistic camps. The rivalries between the two super powers for military
supremacy, ideological conflicts and rivalry to gain economic supremacy lead to
the establishment of a bipolar world. Though this conflict did not leave much space

for those who did not want

attempt to create one. The
core concerns of people,

the insecure and tense
situation. So, in 1955, a conference was held at Bandung in Indonesia. It was the
first Asio-African conference represented by 29 nations. The most important leaders
of this conference were Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India,
Gamal Abdel Nasser, the leader of Egypt and Josip Broz Tito, the leader of Yugoslavia.
Pt. Nehru was acknowledged as the chief spokesperson. It paved the way for Non
Aligned Movement (NAM).
Thus, non-alignment was established as an international organisation with an
aim to promote cultural and economic cooperation among the newly independent
countries of Asia, Africa and later Latin America.
The first Summit was held at Belgrade in Yugoslavia in September 1961. It was
attended by 25 member countries. By 2012, the membership has grown to 120
countries with 17 Observers. The first Summit was the culmination of three major
concerns:
- Cooperation among the member nations of NAM, most of them had newly
emerged as free countries.
- Growing Cold War tensions and its impact on the world at large.
- To prevent any of the newly decolonised independent countries from joining
any of the military blocks.
Over the years, the NAM helped countries like India to take an independent
position when the two super powers fell apart and pulled countries to their side. It
also helped the newly emerging countries to bargain for space and assistance from
the super powers by playing one against the other. To some extent, it also helped to
ease tensions amongst the NAM countries. Even though both the blocks looked at
NAM with suspicion, the US regarded the NAM as being closer to the USSR on
wider international issues. Its inaction in the case of Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

West Asian Conflicts

West Asia refers to the region towards the west of Asia. The term ‘Middle
East’ is also used to describe this area. The conflicts that developed between Arabs
and Jews are often described as the West Asian Crisis. It was mainly related to the
occupation of Palestine. Palestine, which was inhabited by Arabs, was under the
control of Britain before Second World War. Jerusalem, which is a holy city for
Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is situated in it.
The Jews traditionally considered Palestine as their ‘Promised Land’ from where
they had been exiled in ancient times and pushed across Europe and Asia. In Europe,
they were a persecuted community as Christians considered them responsible for
the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The conflict came to a head in Germany under the
Nazis when millions of Jews of Europe were jailed and killed.
A movement had emerged among the Jews called the ‘Zionist Movement’ which
called for uniting Jews spread across the world and to reclaim Palestine as their
homeland and build a separate state for Jews. After 1945, this demand was supported
by Western powers. However, since Palestinians (who were mostly Arab Muslims)
were already living there, this became a bone of contention.
Matters were also complicated by the discovery of massive oil reserves in the
Middle East, especially in the Arabian peninsula. Both US and USSR wanted to
bring this region under their sphere of influence and would not let the other country
establish its control.
In 1947, United Nations passed a resolution, according to which, Palestine
was divided into two parts -Arab and Jewish States. In 1948, the British withdrew
their troops from Palestine and Israel was created for Jews. The Arabs did not
agree to giving up their homeland. The Arabs refused to recognise Israel as a
legitimate state. The policies pursued by the state of Israel increased the bitterness.
The Arabs were forced to leave their homes and properties and had to take shelter
as refugees in the other Arab states.
The President of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918-1970), made an effort to
unite the Arabs. He formed fidayeens (suicide squads) for causing explosions in

West Bank. Israel while refusing to return the occupied territories despite UN
resolution, agreed for a ceasefire. Israel believed that these occupied territories
would act as buffer zones. This war was a setback to the Arab cause.
In the meanwhile, an organisation called Palestinian Liberation Organisation
(PLO hereafter) was established in 1964 in Jordon and added a new dimension by
bringing together all the different Arab factions. Its aim was to regain the land it
lost without violence. However, in 1967, PLO under the leadership of Yasser Arafat
applied pressure and force on Arab states to attack Israel. But the Arab states were
not very enthusiastic. Hence, a faction of PLO lead by Arafat carried out terrorist
attacks like plane hijackings, holding the Israeli Olympic Squad at the Munich

Israel agreed to withdraw its forces from West Bank in addition to giving voting
rights to the Arab residents of Palestine. However, this was not successful as Israel
failed to implement its promises and continued to attack the Palestinians under
one pretext or the other. Many countries agreed to recognise the PLO as the

The continued support of the US to Israel and the plight of Palestinians created
a widespread feeling against the US in the region. The US also became unpopular
because it supported undemocratic regimes in this area so that the oil resources
were available to the US and its allies. People, on the other hand, wanted the revenues
from oil resources to be used for the welfare of common people who did not have
any other resources in the desert area. In 1968, a coup took place in Iraq in which
Saddam Husain came to power with the twin slogan of Arab Nationalism and
Socialism. By socialism, they meant nationalisation of oil resources and the use
of oil revenues by the state to fund welfare measures for the citizens. Similar
developments took place in Libya in 1969 (you have read about this in class IX,
chapter 18). These regimes combined welfare policies with autocratic and
dictatorial rule of a ruler or a small group. They did not allow any opposition or
democratic protest against themselves.
In many cases, the opposition to the US and US backed regimes took religious
colours. Nationalist forces, instead of supporting the idea of equitable distribution
of wealth and opportunities, fostered the idea of establishing religious orthodoxy
in those countries. A revolution took place in Iran in 1979 in which the old King of
Iran (who was supported by the US) was removed and a new government jointly
controlled by Shia Islamic clerics and democratically elected leaders was
established.
The Taliban, which took over Afghanistan after the withdrawal of Soviet troops,

people to strictly follow the rules laid down in religious texts. In many cases, this
meant the denial of basic freedom and equality of opportunity to women and
religious minorities.
The beginning of the twenty first century witnessed growing discontent among
the Arabs which resulted in the growth of religious terrorism. Some Arab terrorists

Peace Movements, Collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War
As time passed, USSR and USA came under tremendous public pressure to roll
back the arms race and destroy their nuclear arsenal. You will read more about this
later on in this book. This forced them to hold talks to mutually reduce the stockpile
and weapons race and eventually to ban nuclear tests between 1985 to 1991.

Around the same time, the countries of
Eastern Europe faced serious economic
crises and the USSR was not in a position to
help them. As a result, popular movements
demanding freedom, democracy and
economic reforms swept across Eastern
Europe. Soon, the governments were unable
to manage the country and collapsed. This is
best symbolised by the breaking down of the
infamous Berlin Wall that separated Eastern

This was largely made possible by the coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev
in the USSR. He tried to transform the politics of USSR by making it more open
and bringing about radical changes. He was a
liberal who introduced certain reforms for the
revival of their economy and promoted
healthy relations with the West. The reforms
introduced by the open regime are often
described as ‘Glasnost’ and ‘Perestroika’.

India’s Relationship with China

We saw that India was the founder of the NAM which sought to keep an independent
position between the two superpowers. India tried to base its foreign policy on the
Gandhian principles of peace and non-violence. To emphasise its determination for
peace, Jawaharlal Nehru formulated his renowned Panchsheel principles:
1. Respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
2. Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
3. Non-aggression and settlement of disputes with mutual understanding.
4. Endeavour to achieve cooperation and mutual respect in international
relationships.
5. Promoting peaceful coexistence.
These were to determine India’s relations with other countries, especially its
neighbours – China, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and subsequently, Bangladesh.
Read the following account of India’s relation with its neighbours and understand
the extent to which it has been based on these principles.

After a long struggle and a violent revolution, China became a Communist
republic in 1949. India was one of the first countries to recognise China’s
Communist government. India also supported a permanent seat in UN Security
Council for China, the seat that was earlier occupied by the Chiang Kai Shek
Government. India helped China take part in Bandung conference in spite of their
ideological differences. Both the countries signed the Panchsheel pact on 29 April
1954. The leaders of both the countries visited each other’s country and they were
greeted by large friendly crowds.
During the colonial rule Mc Mahon line was drawn as the border between the
countries. Nehru accepted it. Tibet which lay between China and India was to be an
independent buffer zone. But China annexed Tibet in 1950 on the plea that it was a
dependent state of the old Chinese Empire. This removed the buffer between the
two countries. There was a revolt in Tibet which was crushed by the Chinese.
Thousands of Tibetans escaped along with Dalai Lama and took refuge in India.
India gave asylum to Dalai Lama and this caused a conflict. Chinese started
considering India as an adversary. Prior to this, a border dispute had surfaced between
India and China. China laid claim to Aksai-chin area in Ladakh region and much of
Arunachal Pradesh. Despite many efforts and long discussions, the conflicts have
not been resolved till today.
China tried to invade Indian territories in October 1962, violating the peace
treaties it had signed with India. India was not prepared for this surprise attack and
suffered great losses in the war. Eventually, China declared unilateral ceasefire and
withdrew its troops to its pre-war position. It took more than a decade to resume

As we saw in an earlier lesson, India and Pakistan became independent nations
by bifurcating the erstwhile British India. After partition, the conflicts between
India and Pakistan became perpetual, the main bone of contention between the two
countries being Kashmir.
The first war between the two countries took place in 1947-1948 for Kashmir.
But it did not settle the problem. The war divided Kashmir into two parts: Pakistan
occupied Kashmir (PoK) and the Indian province that were divided by a line of
control.
In 1965, when Lal Bahadur Shastri was the Prime Minister, Pakistan was under
the military dictatorship of General Ayub Khan. Ayub Khan hoped to provoke a
revolt in Kashmir by invading India in the name of liberating Kashmir. However,
the people of Kashmir did not respond to this and backed the Indian state in its war
efforts. India responded

Supporters of Mujibur Rahman organised a liberation struggle in the form of ‘Mukti
Bahini’. India under its Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, began to provide support to
it and tried to win international support for its cause. India also signed a treaty of
friendship with the USSR which promised support to India.
A full-scale war broke out with Pakistan in December 1971. The war ended only
after the liberation of East Pakistan leading to the creation of Bangladesh and declaration
of ceasefire by India. Later, the Shimla agreement was signed between the countries
under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Since the 1971 war, there has been no open war, but innumerable border
skirmishes and battles over respective positions across the border. You may have
heard of the ‘Kargil War’ in which anti-Indian militants had occupied portions of
Indian territory with the backing of Pakistani army and had to be repelled through a
major military operation in 1999.
Pakistan has, over the years, encouraged separatist movements in the border
states of India like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir. India has often accused Pakistan of
not only supporting such movements but actively training and sending religious
extremists to foment trouble in India. Pakistan, in turn, has been accusing India of
trying to destabilise it and constantly threatening it with military action and
stockpiling of nuclear arms and missiles. This has also led to the two countries
spending inordinate amounts of scarce funds on arming themselves against each
other. Both the countries have nuclear weapons and believe that this would act as a
deterrent.
At the same time, given the long history of shared culture and civilisation, the

However, they have had differences over several issues like sharing of river waters

migration of people of Bangladesh into India. The Bangladesh government objected
to fencing of borders by India to prevent illegal entry. It feels that India behaves
like a big brother in this region.
In spite of these differences, both the countries have cooperated on many fronts,

Background
During the first half of the 20th century, the world was dominated by the great
wars, revolutions, emergence of German Fascism, Soviet Socialism, Western
liberalism, national liberation movements etc. However, with the end of the Second
World War and the independence of colonies and semi-colonies like India, China,
Indonesia, Nigeria and Egypt by mid 1950s, a new era began in the world. This was
an era of economic growth and prosperity for most of the countries, but also of
growing tensions in many countries. Sections of societies which had long been
denied equal rights came out asserting their rights.

rules that permitted segregation of blacks

places and discriminated against them in
appointments, housing, and even voting

during the 1960s. It was largely non-violent
and took the form of massive

One of the important actions was the year long boycott of
buses by blacks in Montgomery led by Dr. Martin Luther

eventually forced the court to ban segregation of seats for

In those days, USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe which were within
the sphere of influence of the USSR had a government which did not allow free
multi-party elections, free uncensored press or media, or even freedom of
expression or movement for ordinary people. These governments were constantly
under fear of conspiracies to destabilise them and kept a close control over all
activities of people. As people grew tired of such controls, many movements for
human rights, freedom of expression, movement and free press took place in
different parts of USSR and Eastern Europe. In countries like Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and Poland, this also took the form of demand for freedom from
the control of USSR over them. Some of these movements also received support
from the anti-Communist countries including the USA and UK. These movements
for human rights had many shades of differences. Some of these trends called for
greater freedom for common people, while others sought to dismantle the socialist
system as it existed in these countries. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the famous writer,
and Andrei Sakharov, the nuclear scientist, were important leaders of this movement.

of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Despite this, leading superpowers like

and justifying them as a means of deterring the other powers from using them.

Those were the days of intensive Cold War between the USA and USSR and
America’s war with Vietnam. The entire world was constantly under the fear of
another World War. It was feared that if a war broke out and nuclear weapons were
used, entire mankind would be wiped out of the earth. Thousands of scientists and
intellectuals from across the world campaigned for abolishing all nuclear weapons
and insisted that USA and USSR come to an agreement and end the futile arms
race.
In the Vietnam war, it is estimated that as many as 8,00,000 to 30,00,000
Vietnamese military and civilians were killed, apart from equally large number of
Cambodians and Laotians. USA did not see any civilian deaths but a large number
of military personnel died and more were physically handicapped. Vietnam was a
largely a forested and poor nation in comparison with their opponents, USA and
France. The Vietnamese used guerrilla warfare techniques to fight the war. The
USA invented and used newer arsenal like chemical weapons including napalm
bombs destroying complete villages.
During the early 1970s, more and more American soldiers returned from
Vietnam with serious doubts about the wisdom of bombing innocent people who in
no way posed a threat to the Americans. More and more Americans were also
unhappy about sending their children to war in distant Vietnam. Thus, mass protests

government to end the war and leave Vietnam in 1975. The success of this campaign
inspired peace movements across the world.
The nuclear arms race intensified after the end of Vietnam War as more and
more countries competed with each other to stockpile nuclear arms. Companies
which produced these arms (called the military-industrial complex) and the
governments tried to create a war panic among the common people so that they
could support greater expenditure of tax payer’s money on nuclear arms. Gradually,
many people especially in Europe, realised that war mongering and the consequent
arms race only made the world more unsafe and increased the possibility of a
disastrous war for all countries, even those not directly involved in the conflict.

SC

The economic and political changes happening worldwide since 1990s which
go by the name of ‘globalisation’ or ‘neo-liberalism’ have deeply impacted the
lives of the underprivileged and poor. Tribal people, poor farmers, landless workers,
women, urban poor working in the unorganised sector and industrial workers have
been the worst hit. By and large, these are also the people who do not have access
to formal education or adequate nutrition and health. As a result, they had no access
to better paying jobs or to legal or other constitutional remedies.
During the last few decades, tribals and marginal farmers have also been
threatened by commercial farming, mining corporations, dam projects etc. As the
large companies find rare resources in remote rural areas, like minerals, rare plants
or animals and water, there has been a rapid increase in the ousting of the farming
and tribal population from their traditional areas. This resulted in dispersion of the
communities into new areas and the destruction of tribal cultures. As a result, they
have been reduced to being the most vulnerable sections of the society. Along
with this, such processes of development have severely threatened the natural
resource base giving rise to environmental movements that seek to combine the
voice of the marginalised with the anger over the destructive and violent nature of
these development forces. These movements seek a different vision.

Greenpeace Movement in Europe
This movement initially started as a protest in 1971 against the American
underwater nuclear tests near Alaska. Volunteers set out in a small ship to the test
area to protest. This ship was named “Greenpeace” and this eventually became the
name of the movement. Today, it is spread over forty countries with its headquarters
in Amsterdam (Holland) and has become an important international ‘nongovernmental organisation’.
During the last few decades, scientists have discovered that pollution causes
the depletion of the protective ozone layer in the atmosphere which is important

has been increasing steadily. This is causing the melting of Polar Ice Caps – the
vast accumulation of water in the form of ice on the two poles. As the ice melts and
joins the oceans, the water level of oceans and seas will rise causing submergence
of land in the coastal areas all over the world. Countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka
Mauritius, India and Indonesia where a very large number of people live along the
sea coast will face severe problem of flooding and submergence. Even the people
living deep inside the continent will not be spared as the global warming will cause

Bhopal Gas Disaster related movements
You must have read about the great tragedy which happened in Bhopal in 1984.
A poisonous gas leaked out of the Union Carbide factory (later this factory was
purchased by Dow company). Thousands of people lost their lives and many more
are still suffering from its ill effects. This was perhaps the worst industrial disaster
in the world. Right from the beginning, the people of Bhopal have been fighting for
four main demands: proper medical treatment of the victims; adequate compensation
for them based on international standards as the company was a multinational
company; fixing criminal responsibility for the disaster on the management of the
multinational company; and finally steps to prevent such disasters in the future.

While they have succeeded to some extent, they are still
a long way before they can claim to have achieved all the major
demands. While enormous sums have been spent on setting
up medical facilities in Bhopal, the victims are still suffering
from its effects; compensation has not been paid as per
international standards and that too not properly to all the
affected people. The government has failed to prosecute and
punish the management of the company for its negligence
which led to the accident. We do have better laws today, yet
we still do not have a proper policy or adequate impartial
inspecting mechanism which will eliminate the possibility of
such disasters in the future. The protests against this has been
even more complex since the company itself was based in
USA. People today need to use international laws to fight

Movements against dams on the Narmada river
Building of large ‘multi-purpose dams’ was an integral part of India’s planned
development from 1950s. Some of these included large dams like Bhakra Nangal,
Hirakud, and Nagarjunasagar. In the beginning, people were too awestruck by the
dams, the huge amounts of water it could store, the vast tracts it could irrigate, the
amount of electricity it could generate, the floods and droughts it could control or
prevent. So much so that no one asked about what would happen to the people,

trees, fields and animals who lived in the areas submerged by these dams. Thousands
of trees and animals and acres of fertile fields and people who had been displaced
to build these dams were completely ignored. They had no place to go and had been
evicted with paltry or no compensation. For most people, this was a small price for
the huge benefits that the large dams brought to the people of the country. Soon,
people began to question even this, as it turned out if you actually accounted for all
the expenditure and all the losses incurred in terms of forests and fields and villages,
the investment in the dams did not yield adequate results. This was because the
cost of the dams was huge and often it increased due to delays in construction and
price rise. Secondly, they seldom irrigated the amount of land initially proposed to
be irrigated or produced as much electricity as projected. This was because the
actual amount of water that could be stored in the dams was usually less than what
the engineers had assumed. All these questions came up when the government
proposed to build a series of major and minor dams across the Narmada river in
one of the most ambitious river valley projects in India’s history.
People who stood to be displaced from the project, demanded a fair
compensation not just to those who owned land but all those who lived there. They
also demanded proper rehabilitation with land in return for the land lost and also
afforestation to compensate for the loss of forests under the dam. Soon, people
realised two things: that there was actually no adequate land available to compensate
for the loss and that it was really not possible to rehabilitate all the displaced
people properly. Secondly, people began to realise that the problem was not the
question of compensation or rehabilitation but one of a faulty notion of
development. Development which was based on unsustainable use of natural
resources only paved the way for setting up of industries and commercial farms at
the cost of farming and tribal communities. It only made unskilled manual workers
out of the poor farmers and tribals without enhancing the quality of their lives in
any way.
The leaders of the movement decided to oppose the very construction of the
dams. In chapter 11, you read the letter written by Bava Mahaliya. He was part of
the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA)
that organised peoples movement in
the Narmada Valley against the dam.
Initially, the Sardar Sarovar
Project was expected to be built with
money borrowed from World Bank.
After intense protests, mobilisation,
marches, hunger fasts and an
international campaign, World Bank
decided to withdraw its funding.

Movement of Women for social justice and human rights
We have studied in the earlier classes about the unequal treatment of women
and the struggle being waged by them for equal rights and opportunities, personal
safety and justice. Women have been at the forefront of many important social
movements in the recent past. Here, we will take up two specific examples to
understand this better – the anti arrack movement of Andhra Pradesh and the
movement of Manipuri women against special powers of the armed forces which
had been misused against the people of the North Eastern states.

This is not a story. This is t he achievement of women who have st udied in an

This took place in 1992 and was not an isolated incident. As the news spread,
women of other villages too put an end to the sale of arrack in their villages.
Eventually, they marched in thousands to stop the annual auction of arrack contract
by the Collector of Nellore district. The Collector postponed the auction six times
and eventually the auction had to be cancelled.
In other areas women led marches against liquor shops and picketed and tried
to close down the shops. They tried to stop the sale of alcohol by preventing the
stocking of the shops or deterring the customers from purchasing liquor. Liquor
shopkeepers who refused to close their shops had to face picketing, throwing out
liquor packets stored in the shops or setting the alcohol on fire. In several villages,
women shaved the moustaches or the heads of intractable men, or even paraded
them through the village on donkeys. In addition, men often had to swear oaths in
temples to stop drinking. After innumerable meetings and protests by women across
the state, arrack was officially banned in October 1993 and total prohibition was
imposed in 1995.
These women belonged to the poorest section of our society, from the dalit
castes who were deeply tormented by the increasing addiction to arrack among
their husbands and other men folk. Many of these women had begun to go to literacy
classes and often they would discuss this problem there. These classes gave them
a place to discuss their lives and build networks of contacts. Once the movement
started, its experiences were quickly transmitted to women across the state through
the literacy primers which were read by women in all districts of the state. Thus
women, from the most deprived sections were able to stand up against the most
powerful and violent lobby of arrack manufacturers and sellers who not only had a
lot of money and muscle power but also political power.

Historical Context
Manipur today is composed of two distinctive geographical terrains: the valley
and the hills. Before independence, the valley was under princely rule and the hill
areas were relatively autonomous, mainly inhabited by the tribal population. In
1891, the British established their control over the region though the king continued
to rule the kingdom. The kingdom of Manipur signed a merger agreement with
India in 1949 and Manipur was made a part of India. This agreement was disputed
by many tribes which argued that they had been autonomous and did not agree to be
a part of India.
In response to those opposing the accession with India, the government had
deployed the Army. One of the laws that has been imposed to maintain law and
order is called the AFSPA i.e. Armed Forces Special Powers Act (1958). The Act
gives to the security forces the right to arrest or shoot people simply under suspicion
of being involved in anti-national activities. It is argued that the provisions of the
law have been abused and often there has been torture, killing and harassment of
innocent individuals including women who have been exploited and violated by
security forces. As women and mothers (Ima), they are also worried about their
sons or husband being picked up and tortured under the suspicion of being against
the nation and daughters or mothers themselves being sexually abused. Sometimes,
the women who are abused end up committing suicide. One of the instances that
gained widespread attention was the protest against the custodial death of a 32 year
old woman Thangjam Manorama.
Meira Paibi Movement

SC
ER
T,

Meira Paibi (in Meitei language) literally can be translated as the ‘torch
bearers’. Meira Paibi originated as a movement to prevent public disorder due to
alcohol abuse in the late 1970s. But, it soon became a movement for human rights
with the massive deployment of Indian armed forces to counter the armed movement
for Manipuri independence in the early 1980s. It was also at a time when the state
was declared a ‘disturbed area’ and sweeping powers in the name of AFSPA were
given to the Indian armed forces. This resulted in frequent military operations and
human rights violations. The Meira Paibi responded instantly with protest
demonstrations. The Meira Paibi took to patrolling the streets at night. Women of
every leikai or ward of every town and village participated in the daily patrolling,
bearing no weapons but only the bamboo and rag kerosene torches. Every night, in
every leikai, at every lane junction, groups of women sat on vigil against threats
and disruptions to peace in the community. During periods of relative peace, a few
women would keep the vigil taking turns. But during moments of high tension,
participation is more widespread. These are not activist or politically inclined
women; they are ordinary women who take on themselves the traditional
responsibility for the safety and well being of the community. Meira Paibi group

has also been demanding that AFSPA be revoked. Gradually, the movement against
this Act has grown in strength and women have expressed their struggle in different
forms from boycott of elections to sitting on relay hunger strikes. One amongst
them, Irom Sharmila was on hunger strike for more than 10 years and was under
house arrest.
There have been many attempts to resolve the problem. Sometimes, former
army officers themselves have written extensively about the conflict in the region
and identified that developing better infrastructure and facilities alone can win
over the peoples acceptance. The Government appointed a Supreme Court judge
BP Jeevan Reddy to look into the possibilities of revoking the Act in the region.
Even though the committee has submitted its report, a final solution has not yet
been arrived at.

Some common features across social movements
Social movements have raised diverse demands cutting across strict boundary
of environment or human rights. Their arguments borrow from these different
principles. You may notice that Mahaliya and Luther King too were raising issues
of human rights ideals while raising the questions of environment and equality. In
some context, movements resist changes that are forced upon them. Others like
Martin Luther King or Meira Paibi demand for change. Social movements often
distance themselves from individual political parties and are more united under a
single cause. Its members may belong to different political parties. Often their
programmes are envisaged in a participatory and democratic manner. Social
movements arise when people of a region or of a cause feel that their expectations
have been unmet by the larger political system that is prevalent in a country.

During the last phase of India’s freedom movement, Hyderabad state or the
Nizam’s dominion came into focus of attention. The Nizam was contemplating
the formation of an independent state under his rule when the British left India.
The nationalists of Hyderabad state were against this. Eight districts out of sixteen
districts of Hyderabad state consisted of Telugu speaking people. These parts
came to be called Telangana. Nationalists from Hyderabad spread into villages
and began a campaign for promotion of education in Telugu language, a democratic
form of government and social equality.
In the 1920s and 1930s, Andhra
Mahasabha emerged to promote this
cause. Nationalists from Coastal Andhra
also supported this movement in the
1940s. Soon, the movement also took up
issues relating to land reforms and
opposed the rule of Doras who had the
support of the Nizam and the Razakars.
In view of this internal strife, Jawaharlal

police action and ensured the merger of Map 1: Telangana with United Hyderabad State

There were three distinct regions which spoke Telugu language. These included
Telengana, Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema. Besides different dialects, the three
regions also had different cultures and identities. The Telangana language was
drawn from an inclusive folk tradition which included tribal languages, Deccani
Urdu, Kannada and Marathi while the language of Coastal Andhra was more
influenced by Sanskrit. The culture of Telangana was however, a composite one
and was drawn from Muslim, Dalit, artisanal, tribal, and migrant communities. The
social profile of Telangana was distinct in that it had a larger proportion of tribal
people, backward castes and Muslims as compared to the other regions. Historically,
the coastal regions had a greater influence of Sanskrit culture than Telangana.
They were also under the direct rule of the British and had access to English
education from the starting of nineteenth

While Coastal Andhra was mainly a plain region consisting of deltas with well
developed canal irrigation system, Telangana was a dry plateau region which
depended upon rainfed agriculture, animal herding and hunting and gathering from
forests. The undulating terrain was used to build tanks and this water was used to
cultivate a variety of crops. During the British period, Coastal Andhra was more
developed in terms of its agriculture, trade and industry. At the same time, Telangana
had great potential for development in that important rivers flowed through it and
it had very rich mineral deposits and forests. For this reason, the rich people of the
coastal areas were keen to invest in Telangana to make use of its resources.
Therefore, the demand for Vishalandhra came from Andhra region.

After its merger with India, Hyderabad state became a democratic state in 1952
and Burugula Ramakrishana Rao became its first elected Chief Minster. Andhra
region was separated from Madras Presidency in 1953 and Tanguturi Prakasham
became its Chief Minister. However, there was an active campaign to merge the
Telugu speaking regions into one. While the Andhra Assembly passed a unanimous
resolution favouring merger, a large number of Hyderabad State Assembly members
had serious reservations about the merger. They were worried that the more wealthy
and developed Coastal Andhra elite would dominate the future state, and that the
people of Telangana would lose control over the resources of their region without
gaining anything. They were also worried about educational and employment
opportunities for their youth as the coastal region had a larger number of English
educated youth. On the initiative of the Union Government, the leaders of both
sides met in Delhi and reached what was called “Gentlemen’s Agreement” on 20th
February 1956. The signatories to the agreement were Bezawada Gopala Reddy,
Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, Gouthu Latchanna, Alluri Satyanarayana Raju from Andhra

It was also expected to control the sale of land in Telangana to people from outside

and also ensuring educational and employment opportunities for the youth of
Telangana.

demonstrations, strikes and fasts including fasts unto death. Massive demonstrations
of tens of thousands of people took place and many of them were subjected to
police repression including firing on demonstrators. According to the official
records, three hundred and seventy people, mostly students, lost their lives during
the agitation.
Around the same time, several leaders from Telangana came together to form
a forum called Telangana Praja Samiti to work for the formation of a separate
state, later it took the shape of a new political party. The central government held
long talks and came up with an Eight Point Plan which basically consisted of setting
up several committees. Even though this did not satisfy most people, the agitation
receded for the time being.

In response to the Telangana agitation, a counter movement started in 1972 in
the Seemandhra regions called “Jai Andhra Movement” demanding not only greater
development of the coastal districts but also the removal of Mulki rules relating
to domicile status. Here too, the students formed the main part of the agitation as
they felt that their employment opportunities were being threatened. A six point
formula was formulated by the Central Government in 1973, assuring all the
regions that priority in government employment would be given to local people,
educational opportunities would be expanded in all areas, a Central University
would be set up in Hyderabad etc. At the same time, the Mulki rules and the Regional
Council for Telangana were dropped. In this way, Telangana lost its distinct identity
as promised in the ‘Gentlemen’s Agreement’. All areas of the state of Andhra
Pradesh were treated as one.
Around this time, a new wave of political activity started against repeated
intervention of central government and central leadership of the ruling Congress
party. This led to the formation of Telugu Desam Party and the regional agitations
subsided for the moment.

While income from agriculture per rural person was the same (about Rs. 7800)
for the two regions in 1993-94, it rose steadily to Rs.11800 by the year 2007-08
in Andhra region, while there was no such steady increase for Telangana region and
it rose to only around Rs. 10,000.
At the same time, agricultural labour increased from 38% to 47% of the
population in Telangana region but in Andhra region, it increased only by 1%. This
implies a greater agricultural distress and land selling by farmers in Telangana region
and the conversion of farmers into labourers. Due to drought, failure of crops and
loss of livelihood among people between May 2004 and November 2005, Telangana
region reported 663 suicides out of 1068 reported in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
Thus about sixty three percent of the distress suicides in the state took place in the
Telangana region.
Even in the overall educational attainment, Telangana region remained behind
Coastal Andhra region. The literacy rate in 2001 in Telangana region was 53% but in
Andhra region it was 63%. During the same period, literacy rates were further less
among the poor and socially deprived sections of Telangana region. The total number
of colleges in Telangana region were 159 and if Hyderabad is excluded only 116 but
in Andhra region there were 181 colleges for the same number of youth. In a similar
fashion, the grant for college education was about Rs. 93 crores in Telangana region
and it was Rs. 224 crores in Andhra region.
In addition to uneven development, the people of Telangana region also felt
that they were being culturally discriminated against. After the merger, the language
and culture of Coastal Andhra was promoted as the ideal language and culture and
those of Telangana were treated as being backward. The history, culture and leaders
of Telangana were not adequately represented in the school textbooks. The folk
dieties and festivals of Telangana were being ignored while the festivals and
Sanskritised cultural practices of the Coastal regions were given prominence. The
films too depicted the people of Telangana as backward and crude.
Meanwhile, rich people from the Coastal Andhra and outside the state began
investing in a big way in purchasing land in Telangana, especially in and around
Hyderabad city. While this brought investment into the region, the local people
did not benefit much from this development and were in fact losing control over
their own land to real estate developers.
At the same time, the labourers and poor farmers of Telangana were facing
increasing pressure of different kinds. On the one hand, the poor farmers of dry
lands faced the limitations of agricultural production with little and depleting water
resources. The artisans faced the problem of decline in demand for their produce
and depletion of sources of raw materials like bamboo or wood. Many traditional
service castes like washermen and nomadic communities too felt the pressure of
declining demand for their services and loss of livelihood. While such problems

were being faced by poor people all over the country, the people of Telangana felt
that this was due to the pro-rich policies being followed by the government of the
state to help the Andhra business people. The Telangana people hoped that a genuine
democratic government will make policies that would be more in tune with their
needs. They aspired for a government that would listen to their demands and consider
their problems seriously.

A Telangana Information Trust was set up in 1989 by the intelligentsia to bring
out information on injustices done to Telangana. On November 1, 1996, Telangana
Vidroha dinam was observed in Warangal by a group of intellectuals headed by
Prof. Jayashankar. This gave rise to several popular meetings leading to the formation
of several organisations for demanding the formation of Telangana state. Telangana
Jana Sabha (1997) and Telangana Mahasabha (1997) facilitated the merger of the
movements of the weaker sections with movement for state.
Telangana employees including teachers, Non-Gazetted and Gazetted Officers
formed their organizations. The Telangana intelligentsia came together to hold a
seminar in Osmania University in 1997 and helped to conceptualise the issues
from various angles. The employees, students, writers and cultural activists began
holding seminars, lectures, meetings, dhoom-dhams and so on. The upsurge
produced new cultural activists and their shows became a must in any meeting in
Telangana. Between Jagityala Jaitrayatra in 1978 and Warangal Rytukuli Sangham
public meeting in 1990, new activism gave new direction to the youth and through
them to the rural masses. This period was vital in Telangana movement to prepare
the new generation of activists. With this new spirit, a number of new organizations
were formed.

Many organizational experiments like Telangana Jana Parishad, Telangana
Mahasabha, Telangana Janasabha, and Telangana Aikya Vedika were tried out with
political enthusiasm and spirit of activism but no political party emerged. It was in
this context that Telangana Rashtra Samiti was formed in April 2001.
Meanwhile, Telangana movement was getting expressed in different protest
forms like dhoom-dhams (public song and dance programmes), in garjanas
(massive public meetings to proclaim the demands) and padayatras (marches).
The traditional bonalu (offering to deities), drawing rangoli, was also invoked to
express the popular Telangana demand. The Telangana service castes expressed
Telangana movement in protest-shaving, protest-washing clothes of their customers
on streets, and in collective cooking vanta varpu in public places.
This massive spontaneous people’s movement was going on in the villages

this juncture, students formed a Joint Action Committee (JAC), and then the flings

leader of Telangana Rashtra Samiti, announced an indefinite fast to begin on 29th
November 2009 at Siddipet. He was arrested and lodged in a jail even before he
started his fast. He started the fast in Khammam Jail and subsequently continued it

The announcement was withdrawn on 23rd December 2009 due to the pressure
from Andhra political leaders, and a commission headed by Justice Sri Krishna was
formed to enquire into the developments in Andhra Pradesh and report to the centre.
The Telangana people were shocked. Let us see some possible reasons for the
withdrawal of the announcement.
Hyderabad had become the hub of development. The city had become India’s
calling card for both the success of economic reforms as well as its claim to global
significance. All the resources had been pushed here and this had created imbalanced
regional development. Many people from different parts had invested in properties
in Hyderabad and a large number of people had migrated to Hyderabad in search of
employment and education.
The investors from other regions were worried about their future. The farmers
of coastal areas were also apprehensive about getting irrigation water in the canals
and regular electric supply if the new state was formed. Many of Seemandhra
people felt that it would be unfortunate if a state united by Telugu language was

demerged to form two states. These protests were intended to put pressure on
central government to go back on its announcement of a new state of Telangana.
Meanwhile, a large number of autonomous and non-party organizations
continued their activity of mobilizing the diverse common people to demand an
independent state and to ensure that the new state would represent the interests of
all the people of Telangana. All of them brought diverse sections of the society

into the movement. These organizations gave a political shape to the amorphous
social organizations and strengthened the political movement and the mass
movement from below. These organizations trained fulltime cadres to the Telangana
cause. These activists coordinated the movement at different levels which took
new organizational forms connecting the masses and the leadership.
In order to unite the people, all parties and organizations came together to

this question, he darely replied as the student leader “We would
beg to survive rather than being with Andhra people”. His
effort to strengthen Telangana movement in 1969 is

the second was movements and agitations in different forms

Telangana. Inspired by his ideology, students’ unions, political
parties and Joint Action Committees protested vehemently, thus
the Telangana movement gained momentum. As desired,
Telangana State was formed on 2nd June 2014. He
